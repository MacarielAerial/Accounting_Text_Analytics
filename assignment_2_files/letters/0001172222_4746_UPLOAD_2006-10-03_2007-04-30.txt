OCTOBER 4 2006 PAGE 2 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2005 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES PAGE 44 FREQUENT FLYER ACCOUNTING PAGE 49 1. WE NOTE YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT 1. YOU INDICATE THAT YOU RECOGNIZE REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE SALE OF MILEAGE CREDITS ON A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS OVER THE HISTORICAL USAGE PERIOD. FURTHERMORE THE HISTORICAL USAGE PERIOD PER YOUR RESPONSE IS THE AVERAGE TIME BETWEEN WHEN A MILEAGE CREDIT IS EARNED AND WHEN THE MEMBER TAKES A FLIGHT RESULTING FROM THE REDEMPTION OF THE MILEAGE CREDIT AS DETERMINED BY YOUR STUDY OF SUCH PURCHASED MILEAGE ACCOUNTS. PLEASE FIRST CLARIFY THE MEANING OF EARNED IN YOUR STATEMENT AS MILEAGE THAT IS PURCHASED IS NOT EARNED IN THE SENSE OF MILEAGE THAT IS ACCUMULATED THROUGH FLYING. TELL US WHY YOU BELIEVE THAT THE REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET AND THEREFORE REVENUE EARNED DURING THE HISTORICAL USAGE PERIOD AS IT APPEARS AS THOUGH SUCH REVENUE WOULD NOT BE EARNED UNTIL AT THE VERY EARLIEST THE AVERAGE TIME A MEMBER TAKES A FLIGHT GIVEN THAT NO SERVICES HAVE BEEN RENDERED PRIOR TO THAT POINT. WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO DEFER ALL SUCH REVENUE UNTIL THE AVERAGE TIME AT WHICH A MEMBER TAKES A FLIGHT AND RECOGNIZE THROUGH THE DATE OF EXPIRATION. PLEASE REFER TO SAB 104 AND ADVISE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING WHEN YOU BELIEVE THE SERVICES REQUIRED FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION HAVE BEEN RENDERED. YOU MAY CONTACT HEATHER TRESS AT 202-551-3624 OR LYN SHENK AT 202-551-3380 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS REGARDING COMMENTS ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED MATTERS.
