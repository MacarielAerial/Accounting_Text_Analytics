THIS LETTER WILL RESPOND TO EACH OF YOUR COMMENTS IN THE ORDER PRESENTED IN YOUR LETTER.

HUMPHREY BRANCH CHIEF SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION MARCH 7 2008 PAGE -2- FORM 10-K (FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2007) ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 25 OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE PAGE 28 1. REFERENCE IS MADE TO YOUR PARAGRAPH DISCUSSION OF THE 6.2 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF TWO AIRCRAFT. PLEASE EXPAND YOUR REASONS FOR THE PURCHASE OF THE TWO AIRCRAFT AND MANAGEMENT S SUBSEQUENT DETERMINATION TO SELL THE AIRCRAFT SHORTLY AFTER PURCHASE. PLEASE DESCRIBE THE TYPE OF AIRCRAFT THAT WAS PURCHASED AND THEN SOLD. ALSO THE GAIN ON THE SALE SHOULD BE RECLASSIFIED AS A COMPONENT OF OPERATING INCOME IN THE STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND IN FUTURE DISCUSSIONS IN MD A. REFER TO PARAGRAPH 45 OF SFAS NO. 144. DURING 2003 AIRTRAN ENTERED INTO A PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH BOEING TO PURCHASE BOEING B737 (B737) AIRCRAFT. GIVEN THE COST AND TIME IT TAKES TO MANUFACTURE AN AIRCRAFT IT IS CUSTOMARY FOR AIRLINES TO ENTER INTO AIRCRAFT PURCHASE AGREEMENTS SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE ACTUALLY TAKING DELIVERY OF THE AIRCRAFT BASED ON THE AIRLINE S PROJECTIONS OF ITS FUTURE CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS AT THAT TIME. THE AIRCRAFT THAT THE COMPANY SOLD DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007 WERE ACQUIRED PURSUANT TO THE 2003 AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE B737 AIRCRAFT. THE DECISION TO SELL THE TWO AIRCRAFT WAS DRIVEN BY THE COMPANY S CONCLUSION BASED ON VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING THE COMPANY S NEAR TERM EXPANSION PLANS THAT IT WOULD MODERATE THE GROWTH IN THE COMPANY S FLEET SIZE. CONSEQUENTLY THE COMPANY SOLD TWO OF TWELVE AIRCRAFT SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY IN 2007. THE TWO AIRCRAFT WERE SOLD IMMEDIATELY UPON THE PURCHASE BY COMPANY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CLASSIFYING THE GAIN ON SALE OF THE TWO AIRCRAFT AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE IS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THE COMPANY DID NOT OPERATE THE TWO AIRCRAFT IN REVENUE SERVICE. IN FACT AT THE TIME THE AIRCRAFT WERE PURCHASED THE COMPANY HAD A BINDING CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TO IMMEDIATELY SELL THE AIRCRAFT. GIVEN THAT THE TWO AIRCRAFT WERE NEVER OPERATED IN REVENUE SERVICE THE AIRCRAFT WERE NOT CONSIDERED LONG-LIVED ASSETS AS CONTEMPLATED IN SFAS NO. 144. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE GAIN BELOW OPERATING INCOME IS PROPER AS THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE TRANSACTION IS MORE OF A FINANCIAL TRANSACTION INVOLVING THE SALE OF A RIGHT TO ACQUIRE THE AIRCRAFT RATHER THAN THE SALE OF AN OPERATING ASSET. THE COMPANY PROPOSES TO REVISE ITS FUTURE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES DISCUSSION OF AIRCRAFT ACQUISITIONS AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION: DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007 WE TOOK DELIVERY OF TWO B737 AIRCRAFT PREVIOUSLY ORDERED AND IMMEDIATELY SOLD THE TWO AIRCRAFT FOR CASH PROCEEDS OF 77.9 MILLION OF WHICH 5.0 MILLION WAS RECEIVED PRIOR TO 2007. THE TWO AIRCRAFT THAT WE SOLD WERE ACQUIRED PURSUANT TO A 2003 AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE B737 AIRCRAFT. THE DECISION TO SELL THE TWO AIRCRAFT WAS DRIVEN BY OUR CONCLUSION BASED ON VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING OUR NEAR TERM EXPANSION PLANS THAT WE ______________________________________________________________________ MR. DAVID R. HUMPHREY BRANCH CHIEF SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION MARCH 7 2008 PAGE -3- WOULD MODERATE THE GROWTH IN OUR FLEET SIZE. CONSEQUENTLY WE SOLD TWO OF THE TWELVE AIRCRAFT SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY IN 2007 AND RECOGNIZED A GAIN ON SALE OF 6.2 MILLION. WE CLASSIFIED THE GAIN ON SALE OF THE AIRCRAFT AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE BECAUSE WE DID NOT OPERATE THE AIRCRAFT IN REVENUE SERVICE. 2. FURTHER THE 10.7 MILLION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERMINATION OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER TO ACQUIRE MIDWEST AIR GROUP SHOULD SIMILARLY BE REFLECTED AS A COMPONENT OF OPERATING INCOME. WE WOULD GENERALLY CONSIDER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS AND EXCHANGE OFFERS TO CONSTITUTE OPERATING COSTS EVEN IF THE ACQUISITION ATTEMPT IS NOT SUCCESSFUL. PLEASE REVISE IN THE STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND IN FUTURE DISCUSSIONS IN MD A. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS EFFORTS TO ACQUIRE MIDWEST AIR GROUP ARE APPROPRIATELY CLASSIFIED AS NON-OPERATING. IN THE COMPANY S NORMAL COURSE OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE COMPANY HAS RARELY BEEN INVOLVED IN POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OF OTHER AIRLINES AND CERTAINLY HAS NOT INCURRED COSTS OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THOSE INCURRED IN THIS EFFORT. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE AN INTERNAL MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS (M A) GROUP AND HAS ONLY CLASSIFIED THIRD-PARTY EXTERNAL COSTS WITHIN THE REFERENCE CAPTION ON THE INCOME STATEMENT. BASED ON THESE CONSIDERATIONS THE COMPANY BELIEVES THESE COSTS ARE UNRELATED TO ITS NORMAL OPERATING ACTIVITIES. ADDITIONALLY A KEY METRIC FOR ANALYSTS AND OTHER USERS OF AN AIRLINE S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS OPERATING COST PER ASM. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT INCLUSION OF THE MIDWEST COSTS IN OPERATING EXPENSES (AND THUS IN THE COMPUTATION OF OPERATING COST PER ASM) WOULD INAPPROPRIATELY DISTORT THAT KEY OPERATING METRIC PARTICULARLY FOR THE APPLICABLE 2008 PERIODS AS COMPARISONS TO PRIOR PERIODS WOULD SHOW A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN UNIT OPERATING COSTS THAT WAS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE COMPANY S ACTUAL OPERATING ACTIVITIES. FOR THESE REASONS THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT PRESENTATION OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS EFFORTS TO ACQUIRE MIDWEST AIR GROUP ARE MORE APPROPRIATELY CLASSIFIED AS NON-OPERATING AND THAT SUCH PRESENTATION IS MORE MEANINGFUL FOR THE USERS OF THE COMPANY S FINANCIAL INFORMATION. THE COMPANY ALSO NOTES THAT THE COSTS ARE PROMINENTLY DISPLAYED AS A SEPARATE LINE ITEM ON THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AND THUS THERE IS FULL TRANSPARENCY IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS TO THE COMPANY S TREATMENT OF THE COSTS. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 6 - LEASES PAGE 57 3. REFER TO THE DISCLOSURE REGARDING YOUR VARIABLE INTERESTS IN THE LEASING ENTITIES PRESENTED IN THE FINAL PARAGRAPH OF THIS NOTE. PLEASE EXPAND YOUR DISCLOSURE TO MORE FULLY COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF PARAGRAPH 24C OF FIN 46R. THE COMPANY S MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS AS A RESULT OF ITS INVOLVEMENT WITH THESE LEASING ARRANGEMENTS IS LIMITED TO THE REMAINING LEASE PAYMENTS BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS NOT REQUIRED TO ______________________________________________________________________ MR. DAVID R. HUMPHREY BRANCH CHIEF SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION MARCH 7 2008 PAGE -4- PURCHASE THE AIRCRAFT OR FUND ANY ADDITIONAL LOSSES THAT THE LESSOR TRUST MIGHT INCUR. THE REMAINING LEASE PAYMENTS ON THE AIRCRAFT LEASED THROUGH THESE LEASING ARRANGEMENTS WERE 37.0 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31 2007.
