BOTH THE STAFF S COMMENTS AND AMR S AND AMERICAN S RESPONSES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED. AMR CORPORATION FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30 2011 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SIGNIFICANT INDEBTEDNESS AND FUTURE FINANCING PAGE 19 1. WE NOTE YOUR RECENT DECISIONS TO CLOSE A CREW BASE IN SAN FRANCISCO CUT SEATING CAPACITY AND GROUND MORE THAN 10 JETS. WE ALSO NOTE THAT ALMOST ALL OF YOUR AIRCRAFT ASSETS ARE ENCUMBERED THAT CERTAIN OF YOUR DEBT FINANCING AGREEMENTS CONTAIN LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO COVENANTS AND THAT YOU ARE REQUIRED TO PERIODICALLY APPRAISE THE COLLATERAL (AIRCRAFT) TO ASSESS COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS. YOU DISCLOSE ON PAGE 20 THE FACT THAT THE MARKET VALUE OF THESE AIRCRAFT ASSETS HAS DECLINED IN RECENT YEARS AND MAY CONTINUE TO DECLINE. GIVEN THESE EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES PLEASE TELL US ABOUT THE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS THAT YOU CONDUCTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER AS DISCLOSED IN FOOTNOTE 11. DESCRIBE SUPPLEMENTALLY AND IN DETAIL THE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS UTILIZED IN YOUR ANALYSIS AND THE CONCLUSIONS THAT YOU REACHED. EXPLAIN HOW YOU DETERMINED THE ASSETS CONSIDERED TO BE HELD FOR USE AND TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE THE ASSETS CONSIDERED TO BE HELD FOR SALE AND/OR TO BE DISPOSED OF OTHER THAN BY SALE. WE MAY HAVE FURTHER COMMENTS UPON REVIEW OF YOUR RESPONSE. RESPONSE: IN CONNECTION WITH THE AIRCRAFT AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO WITH BOEING AND AIRBUS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011 AND THE COMPANY S ACCELERATION OF ITS FLEET RENEWAL AND REPLACEMENT PLAN THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EVALUATE THE USEFUL LIVES OF CERTAIN FLEETS INCLUDING MD-80 B757 AND B767 AIRCRAFT. HISTORICALLY A CHANGE IN THE COMPANY S FLEET PLAN WHICH REDUCES THE EXPECTED PERIOD OF USE OF AN AIRCRAFT FLEET HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY INDICATOR THAT HAS RESULTED IN AN ASSET IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS. BASED ON THIS AIRCRAFT ORDER AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR FLEET PLAN AND THERE WAS NO DEFINITIVE CHANGE AS OF SEPTEMBER 30 2011. WHILE AN ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE IN OCTOBER 2011 REGARDING CERTAIN 757 AIRCRAFT THIS IS ONLY ONE PART OF THE OVERALL FLEET PLAN CONSIDERATION. NUMEROUS FACTORS ARE EVALUATED IN MODIFYING AND FINALIZING THE FLEET PLAN ALL OF WHICH DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR ESTIMATE OF THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS UTILIZED IN AN IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS AS WELL AS THE ULTIMATE FAIR VALUE OF THE AIRCRAFT THEREFORE WE DON T BELIEVE A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS UNTIL THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE KNOWN. EXAMPLES OF THESE FACTORS IMPACTING OUR ESTIMATE OF UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY NOT KNOWN INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO FUTURE CAPACITY DECISIONS WHETHER LEASED OR OWNED AIRCRAFT MAY BE GROUNDED WHETHER THE AIRCRAFT IS MORTGAGED THE AGE OF THE GROUNDED AIRCRAFT AND THE RESPECTIVE MAINTENANCE OBLIGATIONS. FACTORS IMPACTING THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE OF THE AIRCRAFT INCLUDE THE AGE OF THE AIRCRAFT WHEN RETIRED MAINTENANCE CONDITION AND OTHER INDUSTRY CONDITIONS THAT MAY IMPACT THE FAIR VALUE (E.G. WHETHER OTHER AIRLINES ARE RETIRING A FLEET AND THEREFORE THERE IS EXCESS SUPPLY IN THE MARKET). THE COMPANY IS STILL FINALIZING ITS FLEET PLANS INCLUDING WHETHER THE AIRCRAFT THE COMMISSION REFERS TO ABOVE ARE LEASED OR OWNED AIRCRAFT AND ACCORDINGLY BELIEVES A TRIGGERING EVENT HAD NOT OCCURRED AS OF SEPTEMBER 30 2011. DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND FUEL COST THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EVALUATE ITS CAPACITY NEEDS IN 2012 AND BEYOND. UPON FINALIZATION OF THE FLEET PLAN WHICH IS ANTICIPATED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER INCLUDING POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THE USEFUL LIVES OF THE AIRCRAFT AN ANALYSIS OF THEIR RECOVERABILITY MAY BE REQUIRED. ADDITIONALLY TO THE EXTENT THE FLEET PLAN INVOLVES GROUNDING LEASED AIRCRAFT WE MAY RECORD EXIT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FUTURE LEASE PAYMENTS WHEN SUCH AIRCRAFT ARE GROUNDED. ONCE OUR FLEET PLAN IS FINALIZED AND WE DETERMINE WHETHER A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED TO DETERMINE ASSET RECOVERABILITY THE COMPANY WILL ESTIMATE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS UTILIZING A MODEL THE COMPANY USES IN MAKING FLEET AND SCHEDULING DECISIONS. THE PRIMARY ASSUMPTIONS AMONG OTHERS INCLUDED IN THE MODEL ARE UNIT REVENUE GROWTH AND FUEL COST IN FUTURE YEARS AND ESTIMATED RETIREMENT DATES FOR BOTH LEASED AND OWNED AIRCRAFT. WE DID DISCLOSE IN OUR THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q THAT AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IF ANY COULD BE SIGNIFICANT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THERE IS VOLATILITY IN AIRCRAFT PRICING MARKETS AND DUE TO THE LONG LIFE OF THESE ASSETS OFTEN THE MARKET VALUE OF AN AIRCRAFT IS BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. MARKET PRICES MAY BE FURTHER NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND WHETHER AIRLINES ARE GROUNDING CERTAIN TYPES OF FLEETS DUE TO CAPACITY DECISIONS OR FUEL EFFICIENCY. WHILE DECREASES IN AIRCRAFT MARKET VALUES MAY BE A FACTOR TO CONSIDER IN ASSESSING WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT HAS OCCURRED TYPICALLY ABSENT A CHANGE IN THE FLEET PLAN (E.G. SHORTENING THE LIFE OF THE AIRCRAFT) THE CASH FLOWS WOULD BE ADEQUATE TO RECOVER THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE AIRCRAFT. ACCORDINGLY WE GENERALLY DO NOT CONSIDER A DECREASE IN MARKET VALUES OF OUR AIRCRAFT IN AND OF ITSELF A TRIGGERING EVENT REQUIRING AN IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS. 2.
