RENEWAL PERIODS AND PURCHASE OPTIONS FOR THE LEASEBACKS ARE ALSO REFLECTED IN NOTE 3 ALONG WITH OUR OTHER AIRCRAFT OPERATING LEASES. ASIDE FROM THE LEASEBACKS THEMSELVES THERE IS NO CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT ON OUR PART FOLLOWING THE SALES SO WE BELIEVE NO ADDED DISCLOSURE WAS REQUIRED.

NOTE 4 -- ASSETS CONSTRUCTED FOR OTHERS PAGE 54 [SPACER.GIF] [SPACER.GIF] [SPACER.GIF] 4. WE NOTE THAT YOU ENTERED INTO A LEASE AGREEMENT WITH THE PORT AUTHORITY OF NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY (PANYNJ) FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF A NEW TERMINAL AT JFK AIRPORT. UNDER THE LEASE AGREEMENT IT APPEARS THAT YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A 635 000 SQUARE FOOT 26-GATE TERMINAL AS WELL AS OTHER AIRPORT INFRASTRUCTURE. IT ALSO APPEARS THAT PANYNJ WILL REIMBURSE YOU FOR CONSTRUCTION COSTS EXCEPT FOR THOSE RELATED TO APPROXIMATELY 80 MILLION IN LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS TO BE PROVIDED BY YOUR COMPANY. YOU STATE THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH EITF 97-10 YOU ARE CONSIDERED THE OWNER OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND ACCORDINGLY YOU REFLECT AN ASSET AND LIABILITY RELATED TO IN-PROCESS CONSTRUCTION ON YOUR BALANCE SHEET. YOU STATE FURTHER THAT YOU CURRENTLY DO NOT EXPECT TO MEET THE CRITERIA NECESSARY TO DERECOGNIZE THE ``ASSETS CONSTRUCTED FOR OTHERS AND/OR THE RELATED LIABILITY WHEN CONSTRUCTION OF THE ASSETS IS COMPLETED AND YOUR LEASE OF THE FACILITY BEGINS. AS SUCH YOU HAVE INDICATED THAT THE ``ASSETS CONSTRUCTED FOR OTHERS WILL BE AMORTIZED OVER THE SHORTER OF YOUR LEASE TERM OR THEIR ECONOMIC LIFE AND FACILITY RENTS WILL BE RECORDED AS DEBT SERVICE ON YOUR CONSTRUCTION OBLIGATION WITH THE PORTION NOT RELATED TO INTEREST REDUCING THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE. PLEASE TELL US IN DETAIL WHY YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU BEAR THE RISKS OF OWNERSHIP OF THE NEW JFK TERMINAL AND RELATED ASSTS DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD CITING THE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE OR CRITERIA IN EITF 97-10 THAT SUPPORTS THE CONCLUSION THAT YOU ARE THE OWNER OF THE ASSETS DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD. ALSO TELL US (I) WHY YOU DO NOT BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL MEET THE CRITERIA TO DERECOGNIZE THE ``ASSETS CONSTRUCTED FOR OTHERS AND (I) WHY THE CONDITIONS OF A SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTION AS SET FORTH IN SFAS NO. 98 WILL NOT BE MET WHEN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ASSETS IS COMPLETED AND YOUR LEASE OF THE FACILITY BEGINS. FURTHERMORE AS YOU INDICATE THAT THE COSTS CAPITALIZED AS ``ASSETS CONSTRUCTED FOR OTHERS WILL BE AMORTIZED OVER THE SHORTER OF YOUR LEASE TERM OR THEIR ECONOMIC LIFE PLEASE TELL US HOW YOU INTEND TO RECOGNIZE THE REIMBURSEMENT OF YOUR CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND WHAT PORTION OF THE COSTS CAPITALIZED AS ``ASSETS CONSTRUCTED FOR OTHERS WILL BE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. WE MAY HAVE FURTHER COMMENT UPON RECEIPT OF YOUR RESPONSE. RESPONSE: THE EITF 97-10 CONSENSUS OUTLINES SEVERAL CRITERIA WHICH IF MET WOULD RESULT IN A LESSEE BEING CONSIDERED THE OWNER OF A REAL ESTATE PROJECT DESPITE ITS NOT HOLDING TITLE. WE ARE MANAGING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS PROJECT AND ARE PRIMARILY LIABLE TO THE CONTRACTORS PERFORMING THE WORK. WE ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR COST OVERRUNS NOT RELATED CHANGES MADE BY THE PANYNJ. THE LEASE WE HAVE ENTERED INTO IS ALSO A ``DATE-CERTAIN LEASE WITH FACILITY LEASE PAYMENTS COMMENCING IN NOVEMBER 2009 WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE CONSTRUCTION IS COMPLETE. UNDER EITF 97-10 GUIDELINES WE BELIEVE ALL OF THESE FACTORS RESULT IN OUR BEING CONSIDERED THE OWNER OF THE PROJECT DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD. SINCE WE ARE ACCOUNTING FOR THE PROJECT AS IF WE WERE THE OWNER WE MUST SATISFY THE CRITERIA IN SFAS NO. 98 IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR SALE AND LEASEBACK ACCOUNTING. UPON COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT WE WILL CONDUCT A DETAILED ANALYSIS TO ASSESS WHETHER WE FULFILL THE SFAS NO. 98 CRITERIA FOR RECOGNIZING THE SALE HOWEVER BECAUSE OF OUR ANTICIPATED CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT PRINCIPALLY THE CURRENT REQUIREMENT OF THE LEASE TO PROVIDE A COLLATERALIZED LETTER OF CREDIT FOLLOWING THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD WE DO NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT TO SATISFY THESE CRITERIA. AS WE INCUR PROJECT COSTS WHICH ARE REFLECTED AS ASSETS CONSTRUCTED FOR OTHERS WE ARE ALSO SUBMITTING REQUESTS FOR REIMBURSEMENT TO THE PANYNJ. AS THESE REIMBURSEMENTS ARE RECEIVED WE ARE RECORDING A CONSTRUCTION LIABILITY WHICH WILL INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD. WE EXPECT THAT UPON PROJECT COMPLETION WE WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OBLIGATION AND RELATED FACILITY LEASE AS A FINANCING WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN APPENDIX B OF SFAS NO. 66. THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF CONSTRUCTION COSTS ACCUMULATED IN ASSETS CONSTRUCTED FOR OTHERS WILL BE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES BASED ON THE APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC LIFE OF ITS INDIVIDUAL ASSETS. _________________________________________________________________ [4]TABLE OF CONTENTS NOTE 12 -- CONTINGENCIES PAGE 60 [SPACER.GIF] [SPACER.GIF] [SPACER.GIF] 5. WE NOTE THAT YOU DO NOT ACCRUE A LIABILITY FOR PRODUCT WARRANTIES UPON THE SALE OF YOUR LIVETV HARDWARE SINCE REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF THE HARDWARE IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE TERM OF THE RELATED SERVICE AGREEMENTS. AS SUCH YOU RECOGNIZE EXPENSES FOR WARRANTY REPAIRS AS THEY OCCUR. PLEASE TELL US WHY YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR ACCOUNTING POLICY REGARDING WARRANTY EXPENSE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF PARAGRAPHS 8 24 25 AND 80 OF SFAS NO. 5. ALSO PLEASE TELL US THE AMOUNT OF WARRANTY EXPENSE THAT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED DURING EACH PERIOD PRESENTED IN YOUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. WE MAY HAVE FURTHER COMMENT UPON RECEIPT OF YOUR RESPONSE. RESPONSE. IN ALL OF ITS SALES ARRANGEMENTS LIVETV SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTERS INTO EQUIPMENT SALES CONTRACTS AND SEPARATE LONG-TERM SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS. THE EQUIPMENT SALES CONTRACTS DO NOT PROVIDE FOR PRODUCT WARRANTY HOWEVER THIS ELEMENT IS INCLUDED WITH OTHER SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR ACTIVITIES WHICH ARE COVERED UNDER THE SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS. BECAUSE NONE OF THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THESE MULTI-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS HAVE EVER BEEN SOLD SEPARATELY WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THEY MUST BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING. THEREFORE WE DEFER ALL REVENUE RELATED TO THE EQUIPMENT SALES AND RECOGNIZE SUCH REVENUES RATABLY OVER THE SERVICE MAINTENANCE CONTRACT TERM AS REQUIRED BY EITF ISSUE NO. 00-21. WE RECOGNIZE SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES ON AN AS INCURRED BASIS. WE BELIEVE THIS TREATMENT SATISFIES THE MATCHING PRINCIPLE DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH 80 OF SFAS NO. 5. IN ADDITION WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY OF LIVETV S AGREEMENTS WILL RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS. LIVETV S TOTAL MAINTENANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR LONG TERM SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS WERE APPROXIMATELY 1.9 MILLION 805 000 AND 151 000 IN 2005 2004 AND 2003 RESPECTIVELY. THE NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT SERVICED UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS DURING THESE PERIODS WAS 193 55 AND 24 RESPECTIVELY. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE EQUIPMENT FAILURE RATES WILL FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM WHAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED TO-DATE. NOTE 13 -- FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT PAGE 62 [SPACER.GIF] [SPACER.GIF] [SPACER.GIF] 6. WE NOTE THAT AS OF DECEMBER 31 2005 YOUR CRUDE OIL OR HEATING OIL OPTION CONTRACTS AND SWAP AGREEMENTS I.E. YOUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WERE NOT DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AS DEFINED IN SFAS NO. 133. AS SUCH CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF YOUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31 2005 WERE REPORTED IN YOUR INCOME STATEMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005. HOWEVER BASED UPON YOUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND OUR REVIEW OF YOUR 2004 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K WE THAT YOUR CRUDE OIL OPTION CONTRACTS AND/OR SWAP AGREEMENTS WHICH WERE OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31 2004 AND DECEMBER 31 2003 WERE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AS THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WAS RECORDED AS A PART OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. PLEASE TELL US THE REASON(S) THAT YOUR MOST RECENT DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT HAVE BEEN ENTERED FOR PURPOSES OF HEDGING YOUR FUEL COSTS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD EXPLAIN IN DETAIL ANY FACTORS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAVE IMPACTED YOUR ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OR EXPLAIN ANY CHANGES TO THE OBJECTIVES OR STRATEGY OF YOUR DERIVATIVE USAGE. ALSO EXPLAIN WHY 13 MILLION OF ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WERE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN 2005. WE MAY HAVE FURTHER COMMENT UPON RECEIPT OF YOUR RESPONSE. RESPONSE. AT DECEMBER 31 2005 NONE OF OUR CRUDE OIL OR HEATING OIL FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS QUALIFIED FOR DESIGNATION AS CASH FLOW HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE WE CONCLUDED THAT THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY WAS NO LONGER HIGHLY CORRELATED TO THE SPECIFIC JET FUEL PURCHASES BEING HEDGED. AS OF DECEMBER 31 2004 ALL OF OUR OUTSTANDING FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EACH WITH 2005 MATURITIES WERE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES AND RESULTED IN OUR DEFERRING 13 MILLION IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR OCI. THROUGH MID-SEPTEMBER 2005 10 MILLION OF THIS BALANCE HAD BEEN SETTLED WITH GAINS RECOGNIZED AS OFFSETS TO FUEL EXPENSE. _________________________________________________________________ [5]TABLE OF CONTENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30 2005 WE CONCLUDED THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CRUDE OIL AND JET FUEL WAS NO LONGER HIGHLY CORRELATED DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE HURRICANES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO IN THE FALL OF 2005 ON OIL REFINING AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS IN AND AROUND THE GULF AND THE ENSUING SHORTAGE OF REFINED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. BECAUSE THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP WAS NO LONGER HIGHLY CORRELATED WE WERE REQUIRED TO REMOVE THEIR HEDGE DESIGNATION AS REQUIRED BY SFAS NO. 133 PARAGRAPH 28(B). HOWEVER THE UNDERLYING FORECASTED HEDGED TRANSACTION REMAINED (I.E. OUR CONSUMPTION OF JET FUEL) RESULTING IN OUR MAINTAINING AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED IN OCI UNTIL THE INITIALLY DESIGNATED HEDGED TRANSACTION HAD OCCURRED AS REQUIRED BY PARAGRAPH 32 OF SFAS NO. 133. CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THESE CONTRACTS FROM THE DATE WE REMOVED THEIR HEDGE DESIGNATION WERE RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. IN ADDITION WE HAD ALSO ENTERED INTO SOME SHORT-TERM CONTRACTS THAT WE DECIDED NOT TO DESIGNATE AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND MERELY MARK-TO-MARKET ON EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE BECAUSE OF THE EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED FOR DESIGNATION AND GIVEN THEIR SHORT-TERM DURATION.
