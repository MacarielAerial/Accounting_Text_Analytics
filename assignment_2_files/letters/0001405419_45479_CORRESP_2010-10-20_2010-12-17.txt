ACCORDINGLY THERE ARE NO REMAINING LOSS CONTINGENCIES RELATED TO THIS MATTER AND THEREFORE NO DISCLOSURES HAVE BEEN MADE. THE COMPANY WILL REVISE ITS DISCLOSURE OF THE SETTLEMENT INCLUDED IN FUTURE FILINGS AS FOLLOWS: ON MAY 7 2009 THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (THE FAA ) NOTIFIED THE COMPANY THAT IT WAS SEEKING A PROPOSED CIVIL PENALTY OF 1 310 000 AGAINST THE COMPANY FOR ALLEGED NON-COMPLIANCE WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO THE USE OF CERTAIN REPLACEMENT PARTS.

THIS SETTLEMENT WAS RECOGNIZED AS OF JUNE 30 2010. 2 __________________________________________________________________ NOTE 10. CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS PAGE 60 AND NOTE 17. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS PAGE 68 4. COMMENT: WE NOTE THAT IN SEPTEMBER 2008 YOU CONSUMMATED A FINANCING IN WHICH YOU ISSUED 5.1 MILLION OF SENIOR DEBENTURES (THE SENIOR DEBENTURES ) AND WARRANTS TO PURCHASE 578 870 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK (THE SENIOR WARRANTS ) TO SHELTER ISLAND OPPORTUNITY FUND LLC. ON THE SAME DATE YOU ISSUED A 12 SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE FOR 1.0 MILLION (THE JUNIOR DEBENTURE ) AND A WARRANT TO PURCHASE 225 000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK (THE JUNIOR WARRANTS ) TO GULFSTREAM FUNDING I LLC AN ENTITY OWNED IN PART BY THOMAS A. MCFALL A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND DOUGLAS HAILEY A FORMER MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AT THE OCTOBER 20 2009 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS THE COMPANY S SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED A REDUCTION IN THE CONVERSION PRICE TO 1.975 FROM 3.00 RELATING TO THE JUNIOR DEBENTURE ISSUED TO GULFSTREAM FUNDING I LLC IN SEPTEMBER 2008. THE CONVERSION TO EQUITY OF THE DEBENTURE AND ACCRUED INTEREST EXPENSE WAS EFFECTIVE ON OCTOBER 20 2009 AND RESULTED IN THE ISSUANCE OF 578 342 SHARES OF THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK. PLEASE TELL US AND REVISE THE NOTES TO THE COMPANY S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FUTURE FILINGS TO EXPLAIN HOW THE COMPANY ACCOUNTED FOR THE REDUCED CONVERSION PRICE THE REDUCTION OF THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER THE PUT OPTION AND CALCULATED THE GAIN OF 194 000 DESCRIBED IN FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30 2010 AS A RESULT OF THE SUBSEQUENT DEBT MODIFICATION. ALSO DESCRIBE IN DETAIL THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT RESULTED IN THE WARRANTS INCREASING FROM 409 827 TO 819 654 AS A RESULT OF THE NOTES NOT BEING PAID AS OF JUNE 30 2010. WE MAY HAVE FURTHER COMMENT UPON REVIEWING YOUR RESPONSE. RESPONSE: THE COMPANY DID NOT REALIZE ANY GAIN OR LOSS IN CONNECTION WITH THE REDUCTION OF THE JUNIOR DEBENTURE CONVERSION PRICE PURSUANT TO ASC 470-20-40-4 WHICH STATES THAT NO GAIN OR LOSS IS RECOGNIZED ON CONVERTIBLE DEBT THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN A BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURE. THERE WAS NO BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURE ON THE JUNIOR DEBENTURES AS BOTH THE ORIGINAL CONVERSION PRICE ( 3.00) AND THE REDUCED CONVERSION PRICE ( 1.975) WERE ABOVE FAIR MARKET VALUE AT THE TIME. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTED FOR THE FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 470-60-35. BECAUSE TOTAL PAYMENTS DUE UNDER THE SENIOR DEBENTURE DID NOT CHANGE UNDER THE FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT NO ADJUSTMENT TO THE RECORDED BALANCE OF THE SENIOR DEBENTURE WAS NECESSARY. THE COMPANY DID RECOGNIZE A NET RESTRUCTURING GAIN ON THE PUT WARRANT LIABILITY WHICH REDUCED THE FACE VALUE OF THE PUT WARRANT FROM 3 000 000 TO 1 050 000. THE GAIN ON THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE PUT WARRANT WAS REDUCED BY THE WARRANT LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASED NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUABLE UNDER THE NEW REMAINING WARRANT AND THE FORBEARANCE FEE. THE NET GAIN WAS CALCULATED AS FOLLOWS: GAIN ON REDUCED PUT WARRANT LIABILITY 1 482 000 FAIR VALUE OF NEW REMAINING WARRANT LIABILITY (1 038 000 ) FORBEARANCE FEE (250 000 ) NET GAIN ON DEBT MODIFICATION 194 000 3 __________________________________________________________________ THE WARRANT AGREEMENT FOR THE 1 000 000 FINANCING TRANSACTION AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE (6) TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30 2010 INCLUDED AN OPTION ALLOWING THE COMPANY TO ISSUE A REDUCED NUMBER OF WARRANTS IN THE EVENT THAT THE DEBT WAS PAID IN ADVANCE OF THE DECEMBER 31 2010 MATURITY. THE COMPANY DID NOT EXERCISE THE EARLY PAYMENT OPTION AND AS A RESULT THE NUMBER OF WARRANT SHARES ISSUABLE UNDER THE WARRANT AGREEMENT INCREASED FROM 409 827 TO 819 654 SHARES. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT EFFECT OF THIS EVENT WAS NOT CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY S FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY WILL REVISE ITS DISCLOSURE OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE MODIFICATION AND RESTRUCTURING OF DEBT INCLUDED IN FUTURE FILINGS AS FOLLOWS: THE COMPANY ACCOUNTED FOR THE FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 470-60-35. THE COMPANY DID NOT RECOGNIZE A GAIN IN RELATION TO THE SENIOR DEBENTURE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OR RATE OF INTEREST. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A NET GAIN OF 194 000 ON THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE PUT WARRANT WHICH REDUCED THE FACE AMOUNT OF THE PUT WARRANT FROM 3 000 000 TO 1 050 000. THE GAIN ON THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE PUT WARRANT LIABILITY WAS REDUCED BY THE ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASED NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUABLE UNDER THE REMAINING WARRANT AND THE FORBEARANCE FEE. THE RECORDED VALUE OF THE RESTRUCTURED PUT WARRANT IS EQUAL TO THE FACE VALUE BECAUSE IT IS IMMEDIATELY EXERCISABLE. THE RECORDED VALUE OF THE REMAINING WARRANT WAS DETERMINED USIN G THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. NOTE 11. LONG-TERM DEBT PAGE 62 5.
