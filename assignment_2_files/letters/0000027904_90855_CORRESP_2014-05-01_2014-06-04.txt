SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES PAGE 56 FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM PAGE 59 SALE OF MILEAGE CREDITS PAGE 59 1. WE REFER TO THE SEPTEMBER 2013 MODIFICATIONS TO YOUR AMERICAN EXPRESS AGREEMENT THAT HAVE CHANGED THE WAY YOU RECORD SKY MILES SOLD. WE NOTE YOUR DISCLOSURE THAT YOU ALLOCATE THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED FROM SELLING MILES TO ALL DELIVERABLES BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE STANDALONE SALES PRICE AND YOU DISCLOSE YOUR METHOD FOR DETERMINING YOUR BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICES. PLEASE CLARIFY FOR US AND REVISE TO DISCLOSE THE TIMING WHEN REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED FOR EACH DELIVERABLE AND THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE REVENUE IN THE STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. IN THIS REGARD YOUR DISCLOSURE INDICATES THAT PRIOR TO THE 2013 AMENDMENT YOU RECOGNIZED THE MARKETING COMPONENT AS OTHER REVENUE AS RELATED MARKETING SERVICES WERE PROVIDED BUT IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW THIS REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OR ITS CLASSIFICATION SUBSEQUENT TO THE MODIFICATIONS. IN ADDITION PLEASE FURTHER EXPLAIN WHY THE EFFECT OF THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING STANDARD LOWERED THE DEFERRAL RATE YOU USE TO RECORD MILES SOLD AND THEREFORE WILL INCREASE REVENUE IN FUTURE PERIODS. WE MAY HAVE FURTHER COMMENT UPON RECEIPT OF YOUR RESPONSE. RESPONSE: TIMING AND CLASSIFICATION OF REVENUE. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE AS WE DELIVER EACH SALES ELEMENT. WE DEFER THE TRAVEL DELIVERABLE (MILES) AND RECOGNIZE PASSENGER REVENUE AS THE MILEAGE CREDITS ARE USED FOR TRAVEL. THE REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE REMAINING DELIVERABLES IS RECORDED IN OTHER REVENUE WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION BEFORE WE APPLIED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (ASU) 2009-13 REVENUE RECOGNITION (TOPIC 605): MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS--A CONSENSUS OF THE FASB EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS AGREEMENT. WE CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE THE REVENUE FOR THESE SERVICES AS THEY ARE PERFORMED. CHANGE IN DEFERRAL RATE. UNDER THE PREVIOUS GUIDANCE WE CALCULATED THE DEFERRAL RATE USING THE RESIDUAL METHOD IN ALLOCATING CONSIDERATION TO THE SEPARATE DELIVERABLES. WE DETERMINED THE VALUE OF THE TRAVEL DELIVERABLE USING THE STANDALONE SALES PRICE OF MILES SOLD TO OTHER AIRLINES AND ALLOCATED THE REMAINING CONSIDERATION TO THE OTHER DELIVERABLES. WE DEFERRED THE VALUE OF THE TRAVEL DELIVERABLE AS PART OF THE FREQUENT FLYER LIABILITY AND RECOGNIZED THE OTHER DELIVERABLES (PRIMARILY MARKETING SERVICES) WHEN DELIVERED. __________________________________________________________________ U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION MAY 1 2014 PAGE 3 AFTER THE MATERIAL MODIFICATION WE ADOPTED THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE METHOD PURSUANT TO ASU 2009-13. THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE METHOD ALLOCATES A TRANSACTION S EMBEDDED PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT ACROSS ALL ELEMENTS OF THE SALE. UNDER THE PREVIOUS GUIDANCE THE PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT WAS ALLOCATED SOLELY TO THE RESIDUAL ELEMENTS IN THE TRANSACTION. WE SELL MILES TO AMERICAN EXPRESS AT A DISCOUNT COMPARED TO THE SUM OF THE SELLING PRICE VALUES OF THE DELIVERABLES. IN OUR APPLICATION OF ASU 2009-13 A PORTION OF THE EMBEDDED DISCOUNT PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED TO THE RESIDUAL MARKETING COMPONENT WAS RE-ALLOCATED TO THE TRAVEL COMPONENT. THE APPLICATION OF ASU 2009-13 TRANSFERRED A PORTION OF THE EMBEDDED DISCOUNT TO THE TRAVEL DELIVERABLE LOWERING THE DEFERRAL RATE AND INCREASING REVENUE RECOGNIZED ON THE REMAINING DELIVERABLES. THE REVENUE FOR THE REMAINING DELIVERABLES IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED WHICH IS EARLIER THAN THE RECOGNITION OF TRAVEL PROVIDED FOR MILES REDEEMED. WE WILL EXPAND OUR DISCLOSURE IN FUTURE FORM 10-K FILINGS TO INCLUDE THE TIMING AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE DELIVERABLES INCLUDED IN THE SALE OF MILEAGE CREDITS.
