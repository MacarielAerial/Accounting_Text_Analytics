WASHINGTON D.C. 20549 RE: SKYWEST INC. FORM 10-K FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2011 FILED FEBRUARY 24 2012 FILE NO. 000-14719 RESPONSE TO STAFF LETTER DATED JANUARY 17 2013 DEAR MR. SHENK: WE HAVE REVIEWED THE COMMENTS SET FORTH IN YOUR LETTER DATED JANUARY 17 2013 REGARDING THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K OF SKYWEST INC. ( SKYWEST ) REFERENCED ABOVE AND OFFER THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES. FOR EASE OF REFERENCE EACH OF OUR RESPONSES IS PRECEDED BY A BOLDED RESTATEMENT OF THE APPLICABLE COMMENT SET FORTH IN YOUR LETTER. FORM 10-K: FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2011 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS PAGE 42 1. REFER TO YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT 2. IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHY YOUR DISCLOSURE SOLELY FOCUSES ON THE ENGINE MAINTENANCE EXPENSES OF THE 96 CRJ200 AIRCRAFT COVERED BY THE UNITED EXPRESS CONTRACT FLYING AGREEMENTS WHEN BASED ON THE TABLE ON PAGE 41 IT APPEARS THERE ARE 141 OTHER AIRCRAFT (I.E. 36 ERJ145S 70 CRJ700S AND 35 EMB120S) ALSO COVERED BY THESE AGREEMENTS. PLEASE ADVISE. _______________________________________________________________________ RESPONSE: IN AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES RAISED IN THE STAFF S COMMENTS 1 AND 2 WE PROPOSE TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIALLY THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURE IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2012: UNDER OUR UNITED AMERICAN US AIRWAYS AND ALASKA FLYING CONTRACTS A PORTION OF OUR COMPENSATION IS BASED UPON FIXED HOURLY RATES WHICH IS INTENDED TO COMPENSATE US FOR ENGINE MAINTENANCE COSTS ( FIXED-RATE ENGINE CONTRACTS ). UNDER THE COMPENSATION STRUCTURE FOR OUR DELTA AND CONTINENTAL FLYING CONTRACTS OUR MAJOR PARTNER DIRECTLY REIMBURSES US FOR ENGINE MAINTENANCE EXPENSE WHEN THE EXPENSE IS INCURRED ( DIRECTLY-REIMBURSED ENGINE CONTRACTS ). WE USE THE DIRECT-EXPENSE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR OUR CRJ200 REGIONAL JET AIRCRAFT ENGINE OVERHAUL COSTS AND ACCORDINGLY WE RECOGNIZE ENGINE MAINTENANCE EXPENSE ON OUR CRJ200 ENGINES ON AN AS-INCURRED BASIS. UNDER THE DIRECT-EXPENSE METHOD THE MAINTENANCE LIABILITY IS RECORDED WHEN THE MAINTENANCE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED ( CRJ200 ENGINE OVERHAUL EXPENSE ). BECAUSE WE USE THE DIRECT-EXPENSE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR OUR CRJ200 ENGINE EXPENSE AND BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE USING THE APPLICABLE FIXED HOURLY RATES UNDER OUR FIXED-RATE ENGINE CONTRACTS THE NUMBER OF ENGINE MAINTENANCE EVENTS AND RELATED EXPENSE WE INCUR EACH REPORTING PERIOD OPERATING UNDER THE FIXED-RATE ENGINE CONTRACTS HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR OPERATING INCOME FOR THE PRESENTED REPORTING PERIODS. THE CRJ200 ENGINE OVERHAUL EXPENSE INCURRED UNDER THE FIXED-RATE ENGINE CONTRACTS DECREASED 22.4 MILLION DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2012 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2011. THE DECREASE IN CRJ200 ENGINE OVERHAUL EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF SCHEDULED ENGINE MAINTENANCE EVENTS DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2012. BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN WE INCUR ENGINE MAINTENANCE EXPENSE ON ENGINES OPERATING UNDER OUR DIRECTLY-REIMBURSED ENGINE CONTRACTS THE NUMBER OF ENGINE EVENTS AND RELATED EXPENSE WE INCUR EACH REPORTING PERIOD DOES NOT HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR OPERATING INCOME FOR THE PRESENTED REPORTING PERIODS. WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD-PARTY VENDOR TO PROVIDE LONG-TERM ENGINE MAINTENANCE COVERING SCHEDULED AND UNSCHEDULED REPAIRS FOR ENGINES ON OUR CRJ700S OPERATING UNDER OUR FIXED-RATE ENGINE CONTRACTS ( POWER BY THE HOUR AGREEMENT ). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE POWER BY THE 2 _______________________________________________________________________ HOUR AGREEMENT WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY A SET DOLLAR AMOUNT PER ENGINE HOUR FLOWN ON A MONTHLY BASIS AND THE VENDOR ASSUMES THE OBLIGATION TO REPAIR THE ENGINES AT NO ADDITIONAL COST TO US SUBJECT TO CERTAIN SPECIFIED EXCLUSIONS. THUS UNDER THE POWER BY THE HOUR AGREEMENT WE EXPENSE THE ENGINE MAINTENANCE COSTS AS FLIGHT HOURS ARE INCURRED ON THE ENGINES AND USING THE CONTRACTUAL RATE SET FORTH IN THE AGREEMENT. BECAUSE WE RECORD ENGINE MAINTENANCE EXPENSE BASED ON THE FIXED HOURLY RATE PURSUANT TO THE POWER BY THE HOUR AGREEMENT ON OUR CRJ700S OPERATING UNDER OUR FIXED-RATE ENGINE CONTRACTS AND BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE USING THE APPLICABLE FIXED HOURLY RATES UNDER OUR FIXED-RATE ENGINE CONTRACTS THE NUMBER OF ENGINE EVENTS AND RELATED EXPENSE WE INCUR EACH REPORTING PERIOD DOES NOT HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR OPERATING INCOME FOR THE PRESENTED REPORTING PERIODS. THE TABLE BELOW SUMMARIZES HOW WE ARE COMPENSATED BY OUR MAJOR PARTNERS UNDER OUR FLYING CONTRACTS FOR ENGINE EXPENSE AND THE METHOD WE USE TO RECOGNIZE THE CORRESPONDING EXPENSE.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ABOVE COMMENT IT APPEARS FROM YOUR DISCLOSURES THAT YOUR SKYWEST AIRLINES ALASKA CAPACITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND SKYWEST 3 _______________________________________________________________________ AIRLINES US AIRWAYS EXPRESS AGREEMENT (TOGETHER AGREEMENTS ) HAVE SIMILAR TERMS AS THE UNITED EXPRESS AGREEMENTS. PRESUMABLY YOU ARE COMPENSATED UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS FOR AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE EXPENSE INCLUDING ENGINE MAINTENANCE EXPENSE AT FIXED HOURLY RATES SIMILAR TO THAT UNDER THE UNITED EXPRESS AGREEMENTS AS INDICATED IN YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT 2. ACCORDINGLY IT REASONS THAT THE REVENUE EARNED EACH REPORTING PERIOD UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS WILL NOT DIRECTLY MATCH THE ENGINE EXPENSE INCURRED EACH REPORTING PERIOD LIKE THAT UNDER THE UNITED EXPRESS AGREEMENTS AS INDICATED IN YOUR RESPONSE. HOWEVER YOUR DISCLOSURE ONLY ADDRESSES THE ENGINE MAINTENANCE EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNITED EXPRESS AGREEMENTS SO IT APPEARS THAT INVESTORS ARE NOT BEING INFORMED OF THE FULL FINANCIAL IMPACT RESULTING FROM ENGINE MAINTENANCE EVENTS INCURRED UNDER ALL SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN COMPARABLE REPORTING PERIODS. PLEASE ADVISE.

CONSISTENT WITH YOUR RESPONSE PLEASE FURTHER EXPAND YOUR DISCLOSURE IN OTHER REVENUE ITEMS ON PAGE 75 WITHIN NOTE (1) TO DISCLOSE WHY YOU BELIEVE THAT PRESENTING RENTAL INCOME AND RELATED EXPENSE SEPARATELY ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS WILL NOT BE APPROPRIATE UNDER YOUR CIRCUMSTANCE.

THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT A COMPONENT OF ITS REVENUE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS IS RENTAL INCOME INASMUCH AS THE AGREEMENTS IDENTIFY THE RIGHT OF USE OF A SPECIFIC TYPE AND NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT OVER A STATED PERIOD OF TIME.

THESE AMOUNTS WERE RECORDED AS PASSENGER REVENUE ON THE COMPANY S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT SEPARATELY STATED AIRCRAFT RENTAL INCOME AND AIRCRAFT RENTAL EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS SINCE THE USE OF THE AIRCRAFT IS NOT A SEPARATE ACTIVITY OF THE TOTAL SERVICE PROVIDED AND THERE IS NOT A SEPARATE PROFITABILITY MEASUREMENT FOR THE DEEMED RENTAL ACTIVITY OF THE AIRCRAFT.
