OVERFLIGHT PAYMENTS TO CUBA IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE CHARTER FLIGHTS AND CONSISTENT WITH THE PRACTICE OF MOST OTHER U.S. AIR CARRIERS CERTAIN JETBLUE FLIGHTS REGULARLY OVERFLY CUBAN AIRSPACE EN ROUTE TO OTHER INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS (SUCH ROUTINGS ARE MUCH MORE DIRECT SAVING TIME AND FUEL AND CERTAIN SERVICE ALLOWED BY TREATIES WOULD NOT BE COMMERCIALLY FEASIBLE WITHOUT ROUTING AIRCRAFT OVER CUBA).

THESE STANDARD OVERFLIGHT FEES ARE PAYABLE MONTHLY AND FOR THE PERIOD JULY 2012 THROUGH JULY 2013 AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY 137 000 PER MONTH.

PLEASE DISCUSS THE MATERIALITY OF ANY CONTACTS WITH CUBA DESCRIBED IN RESPONSE TO THE FOREGOING COMMENT AND WHETHER THOSE CONTACTS CONSTITUTE A MATERIAL INVESTMENT RISK FOR YOUR SECURITY HOLDERS. YOU SHOULD ADDRESS MATERIALITY IN QUANTITATIVE TERMS INCLUDING THE APPROXIMATE DOLLAR AMOUNTS OF ANY ASSOCIATED REVENUES ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS AND THE SUBSEQUENT INTERIM PERIOD. ALSO ADDRESS MATERIALITY IN TERMS OF QUALITATIVE FACTORS THAT A REASONABLE INVESTOR WOULD DEEM IMPORTANT IN MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL 9.20.2013.5 CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED BY JETBLUE AIRWAYS CORPORATION PURSUANT TO RULE 83 __________________________________________________________________ IMPACT OF CORPORATE ACTIVITIES UPON A COMPANY S REPUTATION AND SHARE VALUE. VARIOUS STATE AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS UNIVERSITIES AND OTHER INVESTORS HAVE PROPOSED OR ADOPTED DIVESTMENT OR SIMILAR INITIATIVES REGARDING INVESTMENT IN COMPANIES THAT DO BUSINESS WITH U.S.-DESIGNATED STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM. YOUR MATERIALITY ANALYSIS SHOULD ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE INVESTOR SENTIMENT EVIDENCED BY SUCH ACTIONS DIRECTED TOWARD COMPANIES THAT HAVE OPERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CUBA. IN RESPONSE TO THE STAFF S COMMENT JETBLUE NOTES THE FOLLOWING: JETBLUE S CONTACTS WITH CUBA ARE LIMITED. WE DO NOT BELIEVE SUCH CONTACTS POSE A MATERIAL INVESTMENT RISK TO JETBLUE S INVESTORS. THE COMPANY HAS CONSIDERED BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS IN REACHING THIS CONCLUSION. SPECIFICALLY JETBLUE S TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES WERE APPROXIMATELY 2.6 BILLION IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2013 5 BILLION IN FISCAL 2012 AND 4.5 BILLION IN FISCAL 2011. (JETBLUE OBTAINED ITS OFAC LICENSE AND STARTED THE SUBJECT CHARTER SERVICE IN 2011 AS MORE FULLY DISCUSSED ABOVE IN RESPONSE TO QUESTION 1.) JETBLUE HAS NO ASSETS IN OR LIABILITIES ARISING FROM CUBA. THE REVENUE RECEIVED BY JETBLUE INVOLVING CUBA IS DE MINIMIS AS SHOWN IN THE CHART BELOW (AND THE OPERATIONS TO CUBA (TWO FLIGHT SEGMENTS CURRENTLY ON TWO AND IN THE FUTURE TO BE ON FOUR DAYS PER WEEK) CONSTITUTE A SMALL FRACTION OF JETBLUE S OVER 700 DAILY FLIGHTS). JETBLUE BELIEVES SUCH REVENUES WOULD BE VIEWED AS IMMATERIAL BY INVESTORS IN LIGHT OF JETBLUE S TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES. APPROXIMATE CONSOLIDATED REVENUES OF JETBLUE RELATED TO CUBA CHARTER FLIGHTS ARE SET FORTH BELOW. 2 011 2 012 2013 (THROUGH 6/30) (IN THOUSANDS) [ ] [ ] [ ] TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF JETBLUE S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER GENERAL COUNSEL CORPORATE SECRETARY AND DIRECTOR OF INVESTOR RELATIONS JETBLUE HAS NOT RECEIVED ANY MATERIAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM INVESTORS OR SECURITIES ANALYSTS REGARDING ITS CONTACTS WITH CUBA. THE COMPANY RESPECTFULLY SUBMITS THAT HAVING CHARTER OPERATIONS TO AND FROM AND OVERFLIGHTS OVER CUBA IS NOT UNCOMMON AMONG ITS INDUSTRY PEERS. IN ADDITION THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS OPERATIONS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS AND PERMITS. BASED ON THE ABOVE THE COMPANY HAS NO REASON TO CONCLUDE 9.20.2013.6 CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED BY JETBLUE AIRWAYS CORPORATION PURSUANT TO RULE 83 __________________________________________________________________ THAT ITS EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS OR POTENTIAL NEW INVESTORS TAKEN AS A WHOLE CONSIDER ITS INVOLVEMENT WITH CUBA AS A FACTOR THAT NEGATIVELY AFFECTS ITS REPUTATION OR SHARE VALUE. FURTHER JETBLUE DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS CONTACTS WITH CUBA WILL CAUSE IT TO BE A TARGET OF GROUPS WITH DISINVESTMENT OR SIMILAR INITIATIVES. AS A RESULT THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LIMITED CONTACTS WITH CUBA DO NOT CONSTITUTE A FACTOR THAT A REASONABLE INVESTOR WOULD DEEM IMPORTANT IN MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION.
