WASHINGTON D.C. 20549 RE: PINNACLE AIRLINES CORP. FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2005 FILE DATE: MARCH 3 2006 FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31 2006 FILE DATE: APRIL 27 2006 FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30 2006 FILE DATE: AUGUST 1 2006 DEAR MS. CVRKEL: THIS LETTER RESPONDS TO COMMENTS OF THE STAFF (THE STAFF ) OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE COMMISSION ) CONTAINED IN THE LETTERS FROM THE STAFF DATED JULY 18 2006 AUGUST 21 2006 AND SEPTEMBER 25 2006 REGARDING THE ABOVE-REFERENCED FORM 10-K AND FORM 10-QS OF PINNACLE AIRLINES CORP.

PAGE REFERENCES IN OUR RESPONSES BELOW CORRESPOND TO THE PAGE NUMBERS IN FORM 10-K OR THE FORM 10-Q AS APPLICABLE. _________________________________________________________________ OCTOBER 10 2006 PAGE 2 ANNUAL REPORT OF FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2005 ESTIMATED LOSSES ON SUBLEASED AIRCRAFT PAGE 56 1. PLEASE REFER TO YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT 3. ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS REASONABLE TO RECLASSIFY THE 1 778 FROM TRADE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE TO AMOUNTS OWED TO NORTHWEST WE ARE UNCLEAR AS TO WHY YOUR ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS REQUIRED ADJUSTMENT. AS THERE HAS BEEN NO UPDATE WITH REGARD TO YOUR PRE-PETITION RECEIVABLES FROM NORTHWEST AND DISCUSSIONS WITH NORTHWEST HAVE NOT RESULTED IN THEIR ASSUMPTION OF SUCH LIABILITIES NOR RENEWAL OF THE ASA IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT SUCH A REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE IS WARRANTED. PLEASE CLARIFY WHY THE OFFSET TO THE RECEIVABLE IN THE AMOUNT OF 1 778 RESULTED IN AN ALMOST EQUAL REDUCTION TO THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ALLOWANCE OF 1 565. EXPLAIN THE NATURE OF THE 95 AS SHOWN IN YOUR RESPONSE. RESPONSE: AT THE TIME OF NORTHWEST S BANKRUPTCY FILING WE CONCLUDED THAT WE COULD REASONABLY EXPECT TO RECOVER 5 OF OUR NET PRE-PETITION RECEIVABLE FROM NORTHWEST. ACCORDINGLY AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS WAS ESTABLISHED FOR 95 OF OUR PRE-PETITION RECEIVABLE WHICH CONSIDERED THE OFFSETTING OF PRE-PETITION AMOUNTS OWED TO NORTHWEST. IN CONCLUDING THAT THE ABOVE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS WAS REASONABLE WE CONSIDERED ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION AVAILABLE. THIS INFORMATION INCLUDED CURRENT TRADING LEVELS OF NORTHWEST UNSECURED BONDS AND THE PRE-PETITION AMOUNTS RECOVERED BY THE REGIONAL CARRIERS OF OTHER MAJOR AIRLINES THAT HAVE EMERGED FROM BANKRUPTCY. WE ALSO CONSIDERED THE LIKELY OUTCOME OF FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS WITH NORTHWEST REGARDING AN AMENDED AIRLINES SERVICES AGREEMENT ( ASA ) WHICH MAY REQUIRE THAT WE FORGO SOME OF OUR CLAIMS FOR PRE-PETITION RECEIVABLES IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY MAINTAIN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH NORTHWEST. BASED PRIMARILY ON OUR EXPECTATION OF CONCESSIONS THAT NORTHWEST WILL REQUIRE OF US IN FUTURE ASA NEGOTIATIONS WE CONCLUDED THAT THE 5 RECOVERY ESTIMATE WAS MOST APPROPRIATE. SINCE THE NORTHWEST BANKRUPTCY FILING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005 WE HAVE CONTINUED TO EVALUATE THE REASONABLENESS OF OUR ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE PRE-PETITION AMOUNTS OWED TO US BY NORTHWEST. AS PART OF THIS QUARTERLY EVALUATION WE ADJUST OUR ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS SHOULD THERE BE ANY CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF OUR NET PRE-PETITION RECEIVABLE FROM NORTHWEST. CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF OUR NET PRE-PETITION RECEIVABLE FROM NORTHWEST DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31 2006 PRIMARILY FROM THE OFFSETTING OF THE ABOVE DISCUSSED 1 778 CAUSED THE ADJUSTMENT IN OUR ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS WHICH HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AT 95 OF OUR NET PRE-PETITION RECEIVABLE. _________________________________________________________________ OCTOBER 10 2006 PAGE 3 2. WE NOTE YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT NUMBER 4. NOTE THAT WE WILL NOT OBJECT TO YOUR DECISION TO RECOGNIZE THE FULL IMPACT OF CORRECTING THE ERROR RELATED TO THE APBO FOR THE RETIRED PILOTS INSURANCE BENEFIT IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE FUTURE FILINGS SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO EXPLAIN IN FURTHER DETAIL WHY YOU DID NOT BELIEVE THE REQUIRED ADJUSTMENTS WERE MATERIAL TO THE CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIODS. THE LEVEL OF DETAIL PROVIDED SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO THAT PROVIDED IN RESPONSE TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT NUMBER 4. RESPONSE: WE WILL APPROPRIATELY MODIFY OUR FUTURE FILINGS TO ADDRESS THE ABOVE COMMENT. PLEASE DIRECT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CONCERNING THIS RESPONSE LETTER TO THE UNDERSIGNED AT (901) 348-4262. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE IN THIS MATTER. SINCERELY /S/ PETER D.
