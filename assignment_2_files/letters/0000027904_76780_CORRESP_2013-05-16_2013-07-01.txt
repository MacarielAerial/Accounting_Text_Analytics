WE NOTE FROM DISCLOSURES CONTAINED IN YOUR PREVIOUSLY FILED FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2011 EFFECTIVE JUNE 2011 YOU STOPPED DESIGNATING NEW FUEL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES AND DISCONTINUED HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR YOUR THEN EXISTING FUEL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN DESIGNATED AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES.

IN THIS REGARD PLEASE TELL US WHETHER YOU ENTERED INTO ADDITIONAL FUEL CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES DURING 2012 AS IT APPEARS THE 321 MILLION OF DEFERRED INCOME TAX EXPENSE CONTINUES TO REMAIN IN AOCI AS OF DECEMBER 31 2012. IF YOU DID NOT ENTER INTO AND DESIGNATE ADDITIONAL FUEL CONTRACTS AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US WHY THE 321 MILLION WAS NOT RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS DURING 2012 CITING THE RELEVANT TECHNICAL GUIDANCE USED IN DETERMINING YOUR ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. PLEASE REVISE THE NOTES TO YOUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO EXPLAIN THE CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCE FROM PRIOR YEAR AS IT IS NOT READILY APPARENT FROM YOUR CURRENT DISCLOSURES. WE MAY HAVE FURTHER COMMENT UPON RECEIPT OF YOUR RESPONSE. RESPONSE: WE ENTERED INTO ADDITIONAL FUEL CONTRACTS FORMALLY DESIGNATED AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES DURING 2012 THE LAST OF WHICH WAS DESIGNATED ON DECEMBER 6 2012 PRIOR TO THE ORIGINAL SETTLEMENT DATE OF PREVIOUSLY DESIGNATED ACCOUNTING HEDGES. THESE DESIGNATIONS WERE MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMPANY S DESIGNATION POLICY. CURRENTLY THE LAST SETTLEMENT DATE OF A FUEL CONTRACT DESIGNATED AS AN ACCOUNTING HEDGE IS DECEMBER 2013. TO REFLECT THE FACT THAT WE DID DESIGNATE ADDITIONAL FUEL CONTRACTS AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES DURING 2012 IN OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2012 WE INCLUDED THE LANGUAGE UNDERLINED BELOW IN NOTE 1. THE LANGUAGE INDICATES THAT WE CONTINUED DESIGNATING SOME FUEL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AFTER JUNE 2011. NOT DESIGNATED AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES. EFFECTIVE JUNE 2011 WE STOPPED DESIGNATING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR NEW FUEL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES AND DISCONTINUED HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR OUR THEN EXISTING FUEL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN DESIGNATED AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES. IN FUTURE FILINGS AS APPLICABLE WE WILL REVISE THE INCOME TAX ALLOCATION PARAGRAPH OF NOTE 12 (PAGE 89) AS FOLLOWS (ADDITIONS HAVE BEEN UNDERLINED FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE): WE CONSIDER ALL INCOME SOURCES INCLUDING OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF TAX BENEFIT ALLOCATED TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS (THE INCOME TAX ALLOCATION ). DURING 2009 AS A RESULT OF THE INCOME TAX ALLOCATION WE RECORDED A NON-CASH DEFERRED INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF 321 MILLION ON OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AS A RESULT OF HEDGE GAINS ON FUEL DERIVATIVES AND AN OFFSETTING NON-CASH INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF 321 MILLION. THIS DEFERRED INCOME TAX EXPENSE WILL REMAIN IN AOCI UNTIL ALL AMOUNTS IN AOCI THAT RELATE TO FUEL DERIVATIVES WHICH ARE DESIGNATED AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. WE WILL RECLASSIFY TO EARNINGS ALL AMOUNTS RELATING TO OUR FUEL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS IN AOCI ON THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT SETTLEMENT DATES. AS A RESULT A NON-CASH INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF 321 MILLION WILL BE RECOGNIZED UPON THE SETTLEMENT OF THE FUEL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES. ALL AMOUNTS RELATING TO FUEL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES AND THE 321 MILLION INCOME TAX EXPENSE WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN DECEMBER 2013 UNLESS WE ENTER INTO AND DESIGNATE ADDITIONAL FUEL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES PRIOR TO DECEMBER 2013. __________________________________________________________________ FORM 8-K/A FILED JANUARY 22 2013 EXHIBIT 99.1 2. WE REFER TO NOTE A CONTAINING RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP MEASURES. WE NOTE IN CERTAIN CASES THE DISCLOSURES AS TO WHY MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE NON-GAAP MEASURES PRESENTED ARE USEFUL TO INVESTORS ARE RATHER VAGUE. FOR EXAMPLE THE RECONCILIATION FOR NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS ADJUSTED INCLUDES AN ADJUSTMENT FOR OTHER WHICH YOU DISCLOSE THE MEASURE IS HELPFUL TO INVESTORS TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY S OPERATING ACTIVITIES.
