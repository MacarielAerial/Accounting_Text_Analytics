DECEMBER 20 2012 FEDERAL EXPRESS AND EDGAR CORRESPONDENCE LYN SHENK DIVISION OF CORPORATION FINANCE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION 100 F STREET N.E. WASHINGTON D.C. 20549 RE: SKYWEST INC. FORM 10-K: FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2011 FILED FEBRUARY 24 2012 FILE NO. 000-14719 RESPONSE TO STAFF LETTER DATED DECEMBER 6 2012 DEAR MR. SHENK: WE HAVE REVIEWED THE COMMENTS SET FORTH IN YOUR LETTER DATED DECEMBER 6 2012 REGARDING THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K OF SKYWEST INC. ( SKYWEST ) REFERENCED ABOVE AND OFFER THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES. FOR EASE OF REFERENCE EACH OF OUR RESPONSES IS PRECEDED BY A BOLDED RESTATEMENT OF THE APPLICABLE COMMENT SET FORTH IN YOUR LETTER. FORM 10-K: FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2011 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS PAGE 42 1. PLEASE CONSIDER DISCLOSING THE SIGNIFICANT ITEMS THAT CAUSED MATERIAL CHANGES IN RESULTS BETWEEN COMPARATIVE PERIODS OR A LOSS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD. FOR EXAMPLE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AND FOR THE EXPRESSJET SEGMENT YOU REPORTED A NET LOSS IN 2011 OF 27.3 MILLION AND SEGMENT LOSS OF 98.8 MILLION RESPECTIVELY AND RESPECTIVELY FOR 2010 NET INCOME OF 49.6 MILLION AND SEGMENT PROFIT OF 23.1 MILLION WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY HIGHLIGHTING INFORMATION ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES BETWEEN PERIODS AND LOSSES IN THE LATEST PERIOD. _______________________________________________________________________ RESPONSE: IN FUTURE FILINGS WE WILL ENHANCE OUR DISCLOSURE OF SIGNIFICANT ITEMS THAT CAUSED MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BETWEEN COMPARATIVE PERIODS IN THE FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS SECTION OF MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. 2. IN THE FIRST FULL PARAGRAPH AT THE TOP OF PAGE 43 YOU SPECIFICALLY HIGHLIGHT AMOUNTS FOR CRJ 200 ENGINE MAINTENANCE EXPENSES. IT APPEARS THAT THESE EXPENSES ARE DIRECTLY REIMBURSED TO YOU UNDER YOUR CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH YOUR PARTNERING AIRLINES. PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US AND DISCLOSE THE SIGNIFICANCE TO INVESTORS OF HIGHLIGHTING THIS EXPENSE. RESPONSE: UNDER OUR DELTA CONNECTION CONTRACT FLYING AGREEMENTS WE ARE DIRECTLY REIMBURSED FOR ENGINE MAINTENANCE COSTS AS INCURRED. HOWEVER UNDER OUR UNITED EXPRESS CONTRACT FLYING AGREEMENTS WITH SKYWEST AIRLINES AND EXPRESSJET WE ARE COMPENSATED FOR AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE EXPENSE INCLUDING ENGINE MAINTENANCE EXPENSE AT FIXED HOURLY RATES. THUS UNDER OUR UNITED EXPRESS AGREEMENTS WITH SKYWEST AIRLINES AND EXPRESSJET THE REVENUE EARNED EACH REPORTING PERIOD WILL NOT DIRECTLY MATCH THE ENGINE EXPENSE INCURRED EACH REPORTING PERIOD DUE TO THE MULTI-PERIOD INTERVALS FOR ENGINE MAINTENANCE EVENTS. WE BELIEVE IT IS SIGNIFICANT FOR THE INVESTOR TO UNDERSTAND THE FINANCIAL IMPACT RESULTING FROM THE ENGINE MAINTENANCE EVENTS INCURRED UNDER THE SKYWEST AIRLINES AND EXPRESSJET UNITED EXPRESS AGREEMENTS FOR THE COMPARABLE REPORTING PERIODS. IN FUTURE FILINGS WE WILL CLARIFY OUR EXPLANATION OF THE IMPACT ENGINE MAINTENANCE EVENTS HAD ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PAGE 45 3. PLEASE INCLUDE A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF EACH SEGMENT. THIS IS NOT APPARENT FROM YOUR CURRENT ANALYSIS THAT APPEARS TO BE SOLELY ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS. RESPONSE: IN FUTURE FILINGS WE WILL ENHANCE OUR DISCLOSURE OF SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR EACH SEGMENT IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION OF MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. 4. IN THE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FOR EACH PERIOD YOU PRESENT A TABLE THAT SHOWS THE AMOUNT OF TOTAL PASSENGER REVENUES LESS AMOUNTS FOR CERTAIN ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN REIMBURSED. HOWEVER IT APPEARS IN YOUR CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH PARTNERING AIRLINES THAT YOU ARE 2 _______________________________________________________________________ DIRECTLY REIMBURSED FOR OTHER ITEMS RECORDED AS PASSENGER REVENUES THAT ARE NOT SHOWN IN THE TABLE LIKE INTEREST AIRCRAFT OWNERSHIP COSTS INSURANCE GROUND HANDLING AND CRJ 200 ENGINE MAINTENANCE. SO THAT INVESTORS MAY GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR OVERALL PASSENGER REVENUES PLEASE CONSIDER A TABLE THAT LISTS SEPARATELY AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR EACH TYPE OF MATERIAL REIMBURSED ITEM. RESPONSE: IN THE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FOR EACH PERIOD WE SEPARATELY DISCLOSED THE AMOUNT OF FUEL AND ENGINE OVERHAUL EXPENSE THAT WAS DIRECTLY REIMBURSED UNDER OUR CONTRACT FLYING AGREEMENTS AND RECORDED AS REVENUE FOR THE PERIOD. WE SEPARATELY DISCLOSED THE FUEL AND ENGINE REIMBURSEMENTS BECAUSE THESE ITEMS HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPARABILITY OF REVENUE FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED. GIVEN WE HAVE MULTIPLE CONTRACT FLYING AGREEMENTS AND EACH AGREEMENT HAS A VARIATION OF EXPENSE ITEMS SUBJECT TO DIRECT REIMBURSEMENT WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT WOULD BE MEANINGFUL TO DISCLOSE EACH DIRECTLY REIMBURSED ITEM APPLICABLE TO EACH AGREEMENT. HOWEVER IN FUTURE FILINGS WE WILL ADDRESS THE IMPACT OF DIRECTLY-REIMBURSED ITEMS ON REVENUE AND CONTINUE TO SEPARATELY DISCLOSE THE DIRECTLY REIMBURSED ITEMS THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPARABILITY OF REVENUE FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EXPLANATION WHY ELECTED TO SEPARATE CERTAIN REVENUE COMPONENTS FOR THE READER. CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS PAGE 65 5. REFERENCE IS MADE TO NOTE 1 --OTHER REVENUE ITEMS ON PAGE 75. IN THIS REGARD WE NOTE THAT YOU HAVE EARNED REVENUES UNDER THOSE CODE-SHARE AGREEMENTS FOR AMOUNTS PER AIRCRAFT DESIGNED AS A REIMBURSEMENT FOR CERTAIN AIRCRAFT OWNERSHIP COSTS. YOU ALSO STATE THAT THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT A COMPONENT OF ITS REVENUE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS IS RENTAL INCOME INASMUCH AS THE AGREEMENTS IDENTIFY THE RIGHT OF USE OF A SPECIFIC TYPE AND NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT OVER A STATED PERIOD OF TIME. WE ALSO NOTE THAT THE AMOUNTS YOU DEEM AS RENTAL INCOME UNDER THE AGREEMENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY 14.3 17.8 AND 18.7 OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATING REVENUES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2011 2010 AND 2009 RESPECTIVELY. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE GUIDANCE IN RULE 5-03(B) AND 5-03(B)(1)(C) OF REGULATION S-X REQUIRES SEPARATE DISCLOSURE OF INCOME FROM RENTALS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IF THE AMOUNT EXCEEDS 10 OF YOUR CONSOLIDATED OPERATING REVENUES. IN ADDITION RULE 5-01(B)(2)(C) ALSO REQUIRES SEPARATE DISCLOSURE OF EXPENSES APPLICABLE TO RENTAL INCOME. IT APPEARS THAT YOU SHOULD RECLASSIFY AND PRESENT THESE APPLICABLE RENTAL REVENUES AND EXPENSES SEPARATELY ON THE 3 _______________________________________________________________________ FACE OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. PLEASE ADVISE AND REVISE ACCORDINGLY. RESPONSE: SKYWEST AIRLINES AND EXPRESSJET GENERALLY PROVIDE REGIONAL FLYING TO OUR MAJOR AIRLINE PARTNERS UNDER LONG-TERM CONTRACT FLYING AGREEMENTS. UNDER OUR CONTRACT FLYING AGREEMENTS THE COMPENSATION STRUCTURE GENERALLY CONSISTS OF A COMBINATION OF AGREED-UPON RATES FOR OPERATING FLIGHTS AND DIRECT REIMBURSEMENT FOR OTHER CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING THE AIRCRAFT. A COMPONENT OF OUR CONTACT FLYING COMPENSATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AIRCRAFT OWNERSHIP COST. HOWEVER UNDER OUR CONTRACT FLYING AGREEMENTS COMPENSATION IS AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT EARNED FOR OPERATING FLIGHTS AND THE AGREEMENTS DO NOT SEPARATE RENTING THE AIRCRAFT FROM OPERATING THE AIRCRAFT. THUS THE AMOUNT OF DEEMED RENTAL INCOME ON THE AIRCRAFT IS ESSENTIALLY THE REIMBURSEMENT OF OUR AIRCRAFT OWNERSHIP COST. ACCORDINGLY WE DON T BELIEVE IT IS MEANINGFUL TO SEPARATELY STATE RENTAL INCOME IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS SINCE IT IS NOT A SEPARATE ACTIVITY OF THE TOTAL SERVICE PROVIDED AND THERE IS NOT A SEPARATE PROFITABILITY MEASUREMENT FOR THE DEEMED RENTAL ACTIVITY. ADDITIONALLY PRESENTING THE RENTAL INCOME AND RELATED EXPENSE SEPARATELY ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS MAY MISLEAD THE READER TO BELIEVE THE CONTRACT FLYING AGREEMENT SEPARATES RENTING THE AIRCRAFT FROM OPERATING THE AIRCRAFT WHICH IS NOT THE CASE. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE (1) NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES PASSENGER AND GROUND HANDLING REVENUES PAGE 72 6. YOUR NOTE DISCLOSURE OF PASSENGER AND GROUND HANDLING REVENUES DOES NOT DESCRIBE THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF ITEMS THAT MAY BE INCLUDED IN THESE REVENUE AMOUNTS. IN THIS REGARD WE NOTE THAT AIRLINE COMPANIES MAY GENERATE REVUES FROM MULTIPLE COMPONENTS. THESE SOURCES OF REVENUES CAN INCLUDE SUCH ITEMS AS (I) THE SALE OF THE INITIAL PASSENGER TICKET (II) RESERVATION FEES (III) TICKET CHANGE FEES (IV) BAGGAGE AND OTHER SERVICE FEES (V) GROUND HANDLING SERVICES FOR YOUR AIRCRAFT (AS COMPARED TO THIRD PARTY AIRCRAFT SEPARATELY INCLUDED IN GROUND HANDLING REVENUES) (VI) ON-BOARD FOOD AND BEVERAGES (VII) COMMISSION INCOME (MARKETING COMPONENT) ON SALES OF MILES AND (VIII) CARGO FEES FOR SHIPPING MAIL AND OTHER CARGO. PLEASE CLARIFY YOUR DISCLOSURE TO SPECIFICALLY STATE THE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF REVENUES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN EACH OF THESE OPERATING REVENUE CATEGORIES. IN ADDITION IT IS UNCLEAR TO US IF YOU HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF REVENUES FROM THE SOURCES LISTED ABOVE THAT ARE INCLUDED IN PASSENGER REVENUES. AS IT 4 _______________________________________________________________________ APPEARS THESE ANCILLARY SOURCES OF REVENUES WOULD BE DISTINCT CHARGES FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES SEPARATE FROM THE AIR TRANSPORTATION TRANSACTION (INCLUDED IN PASSENGER REVENUES) THEY MAY BE APPROPRIATELY CLASSIFIED OUTSIDE OF PASSENGER REVENUES IN A SEPARATE OTHER OPERATING REVENUE CATEGORY. AS APPLICABLE PLEASE RE-EVALUATE YOUR CLASSIFICATION OF ANY ANCILLARY REVENUE ITEMS AND CONSIDER WHETHER SEPARATELY CLASSIFYING THEM WITHIN AN OTHER OPERATING REVENUE CATEGORY MAY BE MORE APPROPRIATE. AS THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF REVENUES MAY IMPACT ONE S OPERATING STATISTICS USING PASSENGER REVENUES AND ENABLES INVESTORS TO ANALYZE AND COMPARE PERFORMANCE MEASURES AMONG YOUR PEER AIRLINE COMPANIES WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO APPROPRIATELY CLASSIFY SUCH REVENUES. PLEASE ADVISE AND REVISE AS APPLICABLE. RESPONSE: OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM PROVIDING AIRLINE PASSENGER SERVICE PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF OUR CODE-SHARING AGREEMENTS WITH OUR MAJOR AIRLINE PARTNERS WHICH IS REFLECTED AS PASSENGER REVENUE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. WE ADDITIONALLY GENERATE REVENUE FROM PROVIDING GROUND HANDLING SERVICES FOR AIRCRAFT OPERATED BY THIRD PARTIES WHICH IS REFLECTED AS GROUND HANDLING AND OTHER REVENUE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR MAJOR AIRLINE PARTNERS RETAIN THE ANCILLARY SOURCES OF REVENUE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH AIRLINES ON FLIGHTS WE OPERATE UNDER THE CODE-SHARING AGREEMENTS. IN THE EVENT OUR SOURCES OF REVENUE CHANGE WE WILL EVALUATE THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF SUCH REVENUE IN FUTURE FILINGS. NOTE (6) INCOME TAXES PAGE 82 7.

PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US WHEAT THIS REPRESENTS AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT GENERATED THIS AMOUNT. RESPONSE: IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF EXPRESSJET DELAWARE ON NOVEMBER 12 2010 WE MADE AN ESTIMATE OF EXPRESSJET DELAWARE S CALENDAR 2010 INCOME TAX LOSSES ATTRIBUTED TO THE POST-ACQUISITION PERIOD FROM NOVEMBER 12 2010 TO DECEMBER 31 2010. ACCORDINGLY WE RECORDED THE ESTIMATED TAX BENEFIT FROM THE POST-ACQUISITION INCOME TAX LOSSES AS A DEFERRED TAX ASSET AS OF DECEMBER 31 2010. IN 2011 IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY S 2010 INCOME TAX RETURN WE REVISED OUR ESTIMATE THAT 5 _______________________________________________________________________ RESULTED IN A LARGER ALLOCATION OF EXPRESSJET S CALENDAR 2010 TAX LOSSES TO THE POST-ACQUISITION PERIOD THAN THE AMOUNT ESTIMATED AT DECEMBER 31 2010 WHICH RESULTED IN AN INCREASE TO THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET.
