IN YOUR ANALOGY TO THE EXAMPLE IN FOOTNOTE 1 TO SFAS 95 YOU HAVE NOT ANALYZED A SIGNIFICANT DISTINCTION. IN THE EXAMPLE THE BANK CREDITS PROCEEDS TO A CUSTOMER`S DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNT. IN YOUR SITUATION HOWEVER THE PROCEEDS ARE CREDITED DIRECTLY INTO AN ACCOUNT OF U.S. BANK IN WHICH YOU HAVE NO ACCESS. FOOTNOTE 1 TO SFAS 95 INDICATES THAT CASH INCLUDES DEMAND DEPOSITS AND OTHER KINDS OF ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF DEMAND DEPOSITS IN THAT THE CUSTOMER MAY EFFECTIVELY WITHDRAW FUNDS AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE OR PENALTY. SINCE THE CASH RECEIVED BY U.S. BANK IS AT NO TIME IN A DEMAND DEPOSIT OR SIMILAR ACCOUNT IT IS ERRONEOUS TO PRESENT IT AS AN OPERATING CASH INFLOW.
