GIVEN THAT THE 246 MILLION BENEFIT FROM YOUR CHANGE TO YOUR MILEAGE EXPIRATION POLICY WAS APPROXIMATELY 35 PERCENT OF PRE-TAX EARNINGS FOR 2007 WE BELIEVE YOU SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS FACTOR SIGNIFICANT PROMINENCE IN YOUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DISCLOSURES. THEREFORE PLEASE REVISE FUTURE DISCLOSURES ACCORDINGLY. WE AGREE THAT THE BENEFIT FROM THE CHANGE TO OUR MILEAGE EXPIRATION POLICY WAS SIGNIFICANT AND THEREFORE WE DISCLOSED THIS BENEFIT IN OUR 2007 ANNUAL REPORT IN SEVERAL PLACES INCLUDING: 2 _________________________________________________________________ PAGE NUMBER SECTION SUB-SECTION 3 ITEM 1.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CAPITAL COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 4. WE NOTE YOUR DISCUSSION ON PAGE 3 OF A NEW INTERNATIONAL PREMIUM TRAVEL EXPERIENCE FEATURING 97 INTERNATIONAL AIRCRAFT THAT WILL BE REFITTED WITH PREMIUM SEATING AND OTHER PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS. THERE IS NO DISCUSSION WITHIN YOUR CAPITAL COMMITMENTS SECTION ON PAGE 53 REGARDING THE ANTICIPATED RESOURCES REQUIRED FOR THIS PRODUCT AND THERE WAS NO MENTION IN YOUR LATEST FORM 10-Q FILED ON JULY 24^TH ON THE STATUS OF THIS PROJECT IN LIGHT OF THE RESTRUCTURING OF YOUR OPERATIONS. PLEASE TELL US WHETHER YOU STILL PLAN TO PURSUE THIS SERVICE AND IF SO DISCUSS THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM AND HOW YOU WILL MEET THEM. THE COMPANY S CAPITAL COMMITMENTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL PREMIUM TRAVEL EXPERIENCE PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE LINE ITEM CAPITAL SPENDING COMMITMENTS IN THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TABLE ON PAGE 53 OF THE 2007 ANNUAL REPORT. OUR RECENTLY ANNOUNCED OPERATIONAL PLANS AS DESCRIBED IN THE 2008 QUARTERLY REPORT HAVE NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR INTERNATIONAL PRODUCT UPGRADE CAPITAL COMMITMENTS BECAUSE 94 OF THE 100 AIRCRAFT WHICH ARE PLANNED TO BE RETIRED EARLY ARE USED IN OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND THEREFORE ARE NOT SCHEDULED FOR THIS EQUIPMENT UPGRADE. THE COMPANY S PLANNED CAPACITY REDUCTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO DECREASE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT TO BE UPGRADED FROM THE INITIAL PLAN OF 97 AIRCRAFT TO 91 AIRCRAFT. 3 _________________________________________________________________ AS OF JUNE 30 2008 THE COMPANY HAD COMPLETED UPGRADES ON SIX AIRCRAFT AND HAD REMAINING CAPITAL COMMITMENTS TO COMPLETE INTERNATIONAL PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS ON 85 INTERNATIONAL AIRCRAFT THROUGH 2010. THE COMPANY PLANS TO MEET THESE REQUIRED CAPITAL COMMITMENTS BY UTILIZING ANY OR A COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING: EXISTING CASH WHICH WAS 2.9 BILLION AT JUNE 30 2008 CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND FUTURE FINANCINGS. IN OUR NEXT FORM 10-Q FILING WE WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE REGARDING OUR PROGRAM TO UPGRADE OUR INTERNATIONAL PREMIUM TRAVEL PRODUCT. SPECIFICALLY WE WILL DISCLOSE THAT THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT HAS BEEN REDUCED BY SIX AIRCRAFT AND WE WILL DISCLOSE THE NUMBER OF REMAINING AIRCRAFT TO BE COMPLETED AT THE TIME OF THE FILING. IN OUR NEXT FORM 10-K FILING WE WILL DISCLOSE THAT OUR CAPITAL COMMITMENTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL PREMIUM TRAVEL EXPERIENCE PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE LINE ITEM CAPITAL SPENDING COMMITMENTS IN THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TABLE AND WE WILL DISCLOSE THE SOURCE OF FUNDS THAT WILL BE USED FOR THESE COMMITMENTS. STATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOWS PAGE 72 5. WE NOTE THAT YOUR RESTRICTED CASH INCLUDED AMOUNTS USED AS SECURITY FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION OBLIGATIONS SECURITY DEPOSITS FOR AIRPORT LEASES AND RESERVES WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT PROCESS YOUR CREDIT CARD TICKET SALES. PARAGRAPH 14 OF SFAS 95 REQUIRES CASH RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS TO BE CLASSIFIED BASED ON WHETHER THEY RESULT FROM INVESTING FINANCING OR OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THEREFORE RESTRICTIONS ON CASH SHOULD NOT AUTOMATICALLY RESULT IN PRESENTATION OUTSIDE OF THE OPERATING ACTIVITIES SECTION OF THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT UNLESS THE CASH FLOW ACTUALLY RESULTS FROM AN INVESTING OR FINANCING ACTIVITY AS DESCRIBED IN SFAS 95. IT APPEARS THAT BOTH THE RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS OF THE RESTRICTED CASH RELATED TO SECURITY FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION OBLIGATIONS SECURITY DEPOSITS FOR AIRPORT LEASES AND RESERVES WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT PROCESS YOUR CREDIT CARD TICKET SALES RESULT FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THEREFORE IT APPEARS THESES RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN YOUR STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS RATHER THAN AS FINANCING ACTIVITIES. PLEASE REVISE AS APPROPRIATE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT OUR INTEREST-BEARING RESTRICTED CASH DEPOSITS ARE PROPERLY PRESENTED AS INVESTING ACTIVITIES AS DESCRIBED BELOW. SFAS 95 DESCRIBES OPERATING INVESTING AND FINANCING CASH FLOWS AS FOLLOWS: O OPERATING ACTIVITIES -- PARAGRAPH 21 STATES: OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ALL TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER EVENTS THAT ARE NOT DEFINED AS INVESTING OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN PARAGRAPHS 15-20. OPERATING ACTIVITIES GENERALLY INVOLVE PRODUCING AND DELIVERING GOODS AND PROVIDING SERVICES. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES ARE GENERALLY THE CASH EFFECTS OF TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER EVENTS THAT ENTER INTO THE DETERMINATION OF NET INCOME. 4 _________________________________________________________________ O INVESTING ACTIVITIES -- PARAGRAPH 15 STATES: INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE MAKING AND COLLECTING LOANS AND ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF DEBT OR EQUITY INSTRUMENTS AND PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND OTHER PRODUCTIVE ASSETS THAT IS ASSETS HELD FOR OR USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF GOODS OR SERVICES BY THE ENTERPRISE (OTHER THAN MATERIALS THAT ARE PART OF THE ENTERPRISE S INVENTORY). INVESTING ACTIVITIES EXCLUDE ACQUIRING AND DISPOSING OF CERTAIN LOANS OR OTHER DEBT OR EQUITY INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE ACQUIRED SPECIFICALLY FOR RESALE AS DISCUSSED IN STATEMENT 102. O FINANCING ACTIVITIES -- PARAGRAPH 18 STATES: FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE OBTAINING RESOURCES FROM OWNERS AND PROVIDING THEM WITH A RETURN ON AND A RETURN OF THEIR INVESTMENT RECEIVING RESTRICTED RESOURCES THAT BY DONOR STIPULATION MUST BE USED FOR LONG-TERM PURPOSES BORROWING MONEY AND REPAYING AMOUNTS BORROWED OR OTHERWISE SETTLING THE OBLIGATION AND OBTAINING AND PAYING FOR OTHER RESOURCES OBTAINED FROM CREDITORS ON LONG-TERM CREDIT. THE COMPANY VIEWS ITS RESTRICTED CASH AS AN INVESTMENT AS THE COMPANY IS CONTRACTUALLY LIMITED FROM WITHDRAWING FUNDS FROM THESE DEPOSITS EXCEPT UPON MEETING SPECIFIED CONDITIONS IN THE RELATED AGREEMENTS. ACCORDINGLY THE COMPANY S RESTRICTED CASH BALANCES ARE THE EQUIVALENT OF AN INVESTMENT WHOSE RETURN OF PRINCIPAL REQUIRES THE SATISFACTION OF CONDITIONS RATHER THAN A MERE WITHDRAWAL DEMAND. CHANGES IN BALANCES OF RESTRICTED CASH DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS ARE THEREFORE PRESENTED AS INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS WHEREAS WITHDRAWALS OF INTEREST EARNED ON RESTRICTED CASH DEPOSITS REPRESENT THE CREATION OR RETURN OF AN INVESTMENT AND ARE THEREFORE PRESENTED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. THE COMPANY S RATIONALE FOR ITS STATEMENT OF CASH FLOW CLASSIFICATIONS OF THESE DEPOSITS IS DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW. CREDIT CARD PROCESSOR AGREEMENT TWO DISTINCT TYPES OF CASH FLOWS ARISE FROM OUR AGREEMENT WITH OUR LARGEST CREDIT CARD PROCESSOR. OUR CUSTOMERS MAKE PURCHASES USING THEIR CREDIT CARDS THEREBY CREATING RECEIVABLES FROM THE CREDIT CARD PROCESSORS. THE COMPANY S CASH FLOWS RELATED TO THE DAILY SALE OF TICKETS USING CREDIT CARD ARRANGEMENTS IS NOT RESTRICTED UPON RECEIPT FROM THE CUSTOMER. WE DEPOSIT THESE RECEIPTS INTO UNRESTRICTED CASH ACCOUNTS. OUR DAILY RECEIPT OF THESE CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS REPRESENTS SETTLEMENT OF THE COMPLETE RECEIVABLE DUE TO THE COMPANY BY THE CREDIT CARD PROCESSOR. THESE CASH RECEIPTS ARE PROPERLY CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 95 AS THE CASH RECEIPTS ARISE FROM COLLECTIONS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE RELATED TO THE SALE OF AIR TRANSPORTATION. IN ADDITION OUR LARGEST CREDIT CARD PROCESSOR AGREEMENT REQUIRES US TO MAKE DEPOSITS INTO A SEPARATE INTEREST-BEARING RESTRICTED CASH ACCOUNT. THESE DEPOSITS ARE REQUIRED AS COLLATERAL FOR TICKETS THAT HAVE BEEN PURCHASED AND PAID FOR BUT FOR WHICH TRAVEL HAS NOT YET OCCURRED. THE RESTRICTED CASH DEPOSIT IS SEPARATELY CALCULATED MONTHLY BASED UPON CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF UNUSED TICKETS AND CERTAIN FINANCIAL METRICS REQUIRED BY OUR CREDIT CARD PROCESSING AGREEMENT. THE RESTRICTED CASH DEPOSIT IS INCREASED OR DECREASED EACH MONTH BASED UPON THIS DETERMINATION. THE INCREASE OR DECREASE IN RESTRICTED CASH IS MADE VIA A SEPARATE AND DISTINCT CASH TRANSACTION. CHANGES IN THESE RESTRICTED CASH BALANCES ARE PRESENTED AS INVESTING ACTIVITIES BECAUSE THE FUNDS ARE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE DAILY SETTLEMENT OF CUSTOMER RECEIVABLE TRANSACTIONS. 5 _________________________________________________________________ WORKERS COMPENSATION DEPOSITS RESTRICTED CASH DEPOSITS ARE PRIMARILY REQUIRED BY GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND ARE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT TRANSACTIONS FROM THE COMPANY S ROUTINE OPERATING PAYMENTS FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION OBLIGATIONS. THESE THIRD PARTIES REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO DEPOSIT CASH COLLATERAL INTO INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS WHICH IS ACCESSED ONLY IN THE EVENT THE COMPANY DOES NOT MEET ITS WORKERS COMPENSATION OBLIGATIONS FROM ITS UNRESTRICTED CASH. CHANGES IN THESE RESTRICTED CASH BALANCES ARE PRESENTED AS INVESTING ACTIVITIES BECAUSE THE FUNDS CANNOT BE USED FOR THE PAYMENT OF OPERATING OBLIGATIONS. CHANGES IN OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM CURRENT PAYMENTS AND ACCRUALS ARE PRESENTED AS OPERATING CASH FLOWS UNDER SFAS 95. AIRPORT LEASES THE AMOUNT OF RESTRICTED CASH DEPOSITS FOR AIRPORT LEASES IS LESS THAN 1 MILLION. THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THESE DEPOSITS ARE MAINTAINED AND THE CLASSIFICATION OF CHANGES IN THESE RESTRICTED DEPOSITS AS AN INVESTING ACTIVITY IN THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT IS DUE TO REASONS SIMILAR TO THOSE CITED FOR CREDIT CARD AND WORKERS COMPENSATION DEPOSITS. NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES PAGE 90 (D) AIRLINE REVENUES 6. PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US THE NATURE OF THE SYSTEM PROCESSING ERRORS THAT IMPACT REVENUE THE MATERIALITY OF THESE AMOUNTS AND WHAT CONSIDERATION WAS GIVEN TO THESE ERRORS WHEN ASSESSING YOUR INTERNAL CONTROLS. TICKETS ARE GENERALLY PURCHASED IN ADVANCE OF THE TRAVEL DATE. THEREFORE AT THE POINT OF SALE THE COMPANY RECORDS CASH OR A RECEIVABLE AND AN AIR TRAFFIC LIABILITY ( ATL ) FOR THE COMPANY S OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE FUTURE TRAVEL. AT THE TIME OF CUSTOMER TRAVEL THE COMPANY REDUCES THE ATL AND RECOGNIZES REVENUE IF SUCH TRAVEL IS COMPLETED ON UNITED. THIS IS A HIGHLY AUTOMATED PROCESS. HOWEVER FOR A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF TICKETS REDEEMED FOR TRAVEL ON UNITED REVENUE AND THE ATL ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY UPDATED AT THE TIME OF TRAVEL DUE TO VARIOUS TYPES OF PROCESSING ERRORS OR OTHER FACTORS. AS DISCUSSED IN CHAPTER THREE MARKETING SELLING AND PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION OF THE EXPOSURE DRAFT -- PROPOSED AUDIT AND ACCOUNTING GUIDE -- AIRLINES (THE PROPOSED AIRLINE AUDIT GUIDE ) ISSUED BY THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS ACCOUNTING STANDARDS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ATL ARE FREQUENTLY NECESSARY. COMMON ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ATL RESULT FROM PARTIALLY USED TICKETS INVALID NONREFUNDABLE TICKETS PRICING ERRORS COMPUTER PROCESSING ERRORS AND SO FORTH (PARAGRAPH 3.66). EXAMPLES OF SOME COMMON PROCESSING ERRORS FOR WHICH UNITED ADJUSTS ITS ATL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: O TICKET AGENTS INCORRECTLY NOT ENTERING ALL COUPONS ON A TICKET EXCHANGE WHEN THE EXCHANGE TRANSACTION IS PROCESSED AND RECORDED IN OUR SYSTEMS O INADEQUATE ITINERARY DATA AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEMS WHEN A TICKET SALES VALUE IS ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL FLIGHT COUPONS RESULTING IN THE TICKET PRICE BEING ALLOCATED TO MORE SEGMENTS THAN THE PASSENGER PLANS TO FLY AND O INCORRECT DATA ENTRY OF A TICKET OR COUPON NUMBER FOR A PAPER TICKET PREVENTING AUTOMATED RECOGNITION OF REVENUE FOR SOME PORTION OF THE SERVICE PROVIDED. 6 _________________________________________________________________ DURING 2007 THE COMPANY RECORDED ESTIMATED PASSENGER REVENUE OF APPROXIMATELY 450 MILLION OR APPROXIMATELY 2 OF TOTAL REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED TICKETS THAT WERE USED BUT NOT AUTOMATICALLY PROCESSED AS USED BY OUR SYSTEMS DUE TO THESE KINDS OF ERRORS. THE ESTIMATE RECORDED IS BASED ON MULTIPLE YEARS OF RELIABLE HISTORICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE INCIDENCE OF THESE ERRORS AND THE ANNUAL ERROR RATE DOES NOT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR. ADDITIONALLY WE RECONCILE OUR ESTIMATES OF REVENUE RECORDED FOR PROCESSING ERRORS TO ACTUAL EXPIRED TICKET ACTIVITY WHEN RELATED TICKETS BECOME INVALID AFTER ONE YEAR AND THE ESTIMATES HAVE PROVEN TO BE VERY RELIABLE. WE DEVELOPED THE ESTIMATION PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE AND CONTROL ACTIVITIES SURROUNDING THE ESTIMATION PROCESS TO ADDRESS THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH OVER OR UNDERSTATING REVENUE RESULTING FROM ESTIMATING THE REVENUE IMPACT OF TRANSACTION PROCESSING ERRORS. WE REGULARLY MONITOR THE ACCURACY AND REASONABLENESS OF OUR ESTIMATION PROCESS AND ADJUST OUR ESTIMATES APPROPRIATELY. THE COMPANY EVALUATES THESE PROCESSES AS PART OF ITS ANNUAL INTERNAL CONTROL SELF-ASSESSMENTS AND HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE RELATED CONTROLS ARE OPERATING EFFECTIVELY. 7. WE NOTE YOU WAIT TO RECORD YOUR PASSENGER TICKET SALES AND TICKETS SOLD BY OTHER AIRLINES FOR USE ON UNITED AS OPERATING REVENUE WHEN THE TRANSPORTATION IS PROVIDED OR WHEN THE TICKET EXPIRES BUT YOU RECORD AN ESTIMATE OF MISCELLANEOUS CHARGE ORDERS (MCOS) THAT WILL NOT BE EXCHANGED OR REFUNDED AS REVENUE IN ADVANCE OF THEIR USE OR EXPIRATION (RATABLY OVER THE VALIDITY PERIOD). PLEASE TELL US YOUR BASIS FOR RECOGNIZING REVENUE RELATED THESE SOURCES OF REVENUES DIFFERENTLY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS APPROPRIATE TO APPLY DIFFERING REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR EXPIRATION ON TICKET SALES AND MCOS. THE UNUSED TICKET LIABILITY AND THE UNUSED MCO LIABILITY AGGREGATE INTO ADVANCE TICKET SALES ON THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION HOWEVER THE COMPANY DEEMS IT MOST APPROPRIATE TO DEVELOP A SPECIFIC EXPIRATION REVENUE RECOGNITION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH TYPE OF TRANSACTION. MANAGEMENT VIEWS TICKETS AND MCOS AS SEPARATE HOMOGENOUS TRANSACTION POOLS AND THE METHODOLOGY APPLIED TO EACH TRANSACTION TYPE IS BASED ON THE DIFFERING CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH. TICKETS AND MCOS BOTH EXPIRE AFTER ONE YEAR FROM DATE OF ISSUE. RECOGNITION OF REVENUE FROM EXPIRATION OF TICKETS A TICKET PURCHASE REQUIRES AN INDIVIDUAL TO BUY THE TICKET FOR AN ITINERARY ON A PARTICULAR DATE AND FLIGHT. THUS A CUSTOMER MAKES SPECIFIC TRAVEL PLANS PRIOR TO PURCHASING A TICKET AND TYPICALLY INTENDS TO COMPLETE THE TRAVEL AS TICKETED. IF THE TICKET IS REFUNDABLE THE CUSTOMER MAY CANCEL HIS OR HER TRAVEL PLANS AND REQUEST A REFUND OF THE TICKET PRICE THEREBY EXTINGUISHING THE BALANCE SHEET LIABILITY AND THE COMPANY S OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE THE CUSTOMER WITH FUTURE AIR TRANSPORTATION. LESS THAN 1 OF TICKET SALES EXPIRE DUE TO THE ONE-YEAR EXPIRATION PERIOD. THIS EXCLUDES NON-REFUNDABLE TICKETS THAT ARE RECORDED AS REVENUE AT THE TIME THE TICKETED TRAVEL DATE PASSES IF THE CUSTOMER HAS NOT CONTACTED THE COMPANY TO CHANGE THE ITINERARY WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE NOTED IN THE PROPOSED AIRLINE AUDIT GUIDE. 7 _________________________________________________________________ RECOGNITION OF REVENUE FROM EXPIRATION OF MCOS PARAGRAPHS 3.79 AND 3.80 OF THE PROPOSED AIRLINE AUDIT GUIDE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF MCOS (TRAVEL VOUCHERS) AND INDICATE THAT AIRLINES SHOULD RECORD BREAKAGE RELATED TO TRAVEL VOUCHERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR ESTABLISHED POLICY. AN MCO IS A DOCUMENT THAT CAN BE USED FOR FUTURE TRAVEL ON UNITED. ALTHOUGH MCOS HAVE SEVERAL USES MANAGEMENT VIEWS ALL MCOS AS COMPRISING ONE HOMOGENOUS POOL DUE TO THE SIMILARITY OF THE PROCESS TO ISSUE AND UTILIZE THEM. THE COMPANY USES MCOS TO PROVIDE DENIED BOARDING COMPENSATION FOR PASSENGERS WHO ARE VOLUNTARILY OR INVOLUNTARILY REMOVED FROM THEIR TICKETED FLIGHT AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH ANY REMAINING TICKET VALUE AFTER A TICKET EXCHANGE AND TO PROVIDE A STORED VALUE FOR CONSUMERS TO USE IN THE FUTURE. APPROXIMATELY 16 OF MCOS ARE NOT USED WITHIN ONE YEAR AND THEREFORE EXPIRE. MCOS HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER EXPIRATION RATE AS COMPARED TO LESS THAN 1 FOR ACTUAL TICKETS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: O UNLIKE TICKETS WHEN AN MCO IS PURCHASED OR ISSUED THE CUSTOMER IS NOT REQUIRED TO SPECIFY THE DATE OR DESTINATION OF TRAVEL. O THE CUSTOMER RECEIVING THE MCO HAS NOT INITIATED TRAVEL PLANS AND HE OR SHE MUST DO SO WITHIN ONE YEAR. O THE CUSTOMER MAY NOT WANT TO INCUR THE ADDITIONAL COSTS REQUIRED TO UTILIZE THE MCO (I.E. TICKETS REQUIRED FOR FAMILY MEMBERS HOTELS MEALS ETC.). O THE CUSTOMER MAY NOT HAVE FREE TIME TO TRAVEL OR MAY NOT BE PLANNING TO TRAVEL TO DESTINATIONS SERVED BY UNITED WITHIN THE VALIDITY PERIOD. THE COMPANY CONSIDERED THREE ACCEPTABLE METHODS TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM EXPIRATION OF MCOS. FROM AMONG THESE METHODS THE COMPANY HAS CHOSEN TO USE THE SECOND METHOD DESCRIBED BELOW. 1. RECORD REVENUE AT EXPIRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH PARAGRAPH 16 OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ( FASB ) STATEMENT NO. 140 ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND EXTINGUISHMENTS OF LIABILITIES ( SFAS 140 ). ALTHOUGH THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING THE COMPANY ELECTED TO APPLY THE GIFT CARD APPROACH AS DISCUSSED BELOW. 8 _________________________________________________________________ 2. RECORD REVENUE RATABLY IN PROPORTION TO REDEMPTIONS (REFERRED TO AS THE HOMOGENEOUS POOL OR GIFT CARD METHOD AS DISCUSSED IN AN SEC STAFF SPEECH AT THE 2005 AICPA CONFERENCE ON CURRENT SEC AND PCAOB DEVELOPMENTS). WE BELIEVE RECOGNIZING BREAKAGE REVENUE RATABLY OVER THE ONE YEAR REDEMPTION PERIOD FOLLOWING GUIDANCE PER THE SEC STAFF SPEECH IS AN APPROPRIATE METHOD AND IS THE METHOD USED BY THE COMPANY. BASED ON QUESTION SEVEN OF SEC STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN 101 REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WE ALSO BELIEVE IT IS A REMOTE LIKELIHOOD THAT A MATERIAL ADJUSTMENT TO REVENUE WOULD RESULT FROM THIS ESTIMATE AS THE EXPIRATION OF MCOS CAN BE RELIABLY ESTIMATED USING HISTORICAL DATA. BY RECOGNIZING THE REVENUE RATABLY OVER THE REDEMPTION PERIOD THIS ACCOUNTING BEST REFLECTS THE FACT THAT IN EACH REPORTING PERIOD A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF MCOS WILL NOT BE UTILIZED AS CONSUMERS DECIDE NOT TO REDEEM THEM. RATABLE RECOGNITION DOES NOT RESULT IN MATERIALLY DIFFERENT REVENUE RECOGNITION THAN THE ACTUAL REDEMPTION PATTERN. 3. RECORD REVENUE AT THE TIME THE MCO IS ISSUED. THE METHOD TO RECORD REVENUE FOR MCO BREAKAGE AT THE ISSUANCE DATE IS APPLIED AS AN INDUSTRY PRACTICE AND IS ONE OF THE ACCOUNTING OPTIONS DISCUSSED IN THE PROPOSED AIRLINE AUDIT GUIDE. DUE TO THE DIFFERING CUSTOMER INTENTS WITH RESPECT TO TICKETS AND MCOS AT THE TIME OF THEIR ISSUANCE AND THE HISTORICAL EXPIRATION RATES BEING SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO TRANSACTION TYPES THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS APPROPRIATE TO APPLY TRANSACTION-SPECIFIC REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR THE EXPIRATION OF TICKETS AND MCOS. BREAKAGE REVENUE FROM MCOS THAT WERE ESTIMATED TO EXPIRE IN FUTURE PERIODS WAS APPROXIMATELY 40 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2007. 8. PLEASE REVISE TO DISCLOSE YOUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY FOR MILES SOLD TO THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS CREDIT CARD COMPANIES. IN YOUR DISCLOSURE PLEASE DISCUSS WHETHER YOU USE THE RESIDUAL VALUE METHOD TO ALLOCATE REVENUE AND IF SO HOW THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT IS DETERMINED. ALSO PLEASE DISCLOSE THE PORTION OF EACH PERIOD S MILES SALES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED IMMEDIATELY AND THE PORTION THAT WERE DEFERRED AND THE GROSS AMOUNTS OF MILES SALES PROCEEDS IN EACH PERIOD. ALTHOUGH EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 00-21 REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES ( 00-21 ) EXCLUDED FROM ITS SCOPE THE ACCOUNTING FOR LOYALTY PROGRAMS THE COMPANY ANALOGIZED TO THE RESIDUAL METHOD DESCRIBED IN 00-21 TO DEVELOP ITS ACCOUNTING POLICY. THE RESIDUAL METHOD APPLIED BY THE COMPANY RESULTS IN SEPARATE REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR THE AIR TRANSPORTATION AND MARKETING-RELATED ELEMENTS OF THE MILES SOLD. IN OUR FUTURE FORM 10-K FILINGS WE WILL PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS PART OF OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY. CO-BRANDED CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT THE COMPANY HAS AN AGREEMENT WITH ITS CO-BRANDED CREDIT CARD PARTNER THAT REQUIRES OUR PARTNER TO PURCHASE MILES IN ADVANCE OF WHEN MILES ARE AWARDED TO THE CO-BRANDED PARTNER S CARDHOLDERS (REFERRED TO AS PRE-PURCHASED MILES ). THESE SALES ARE INITIALLY ENTIRELY DEFERRED WHEN PAID TO UNITED IN OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS ADVANCED PURCHASE OF MILES SEPARATE FROM THE MILEAGE PLUS DEFERRED REVENUE LINE ITEM. 9 _________________________________________________________________ SUBSEQUENTLY WHEN OUR CREDIT CARD PARTNER AWARDS PRE-PURCHASED MILES TO ITS CARDHOLDERS WE TRANSFER THE RELATED OBLIGATION FOR THE AWARDED MILES OUT OF THE LINE ITEM ADVANCED PURCHASE OF MILES USING THE RESIDUAL METHOD DESCRIBED BELOW. THIS RESULTS IN RECORDING OF THE AIR TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT AS MILEAGE PLUS DEFERRED REVENUE AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND THE RESIDUAL MARKETING ELEMENT AS OTHER OPERATING REVENUE IN THE PERIOD THOSE MILES ARE AWARDED. THE DEFERRED REVENUE PORTION IS THEN SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED AS PASSENGER REVENUE WHEN TRANSPORTATION IS PROVIDED IN EXCHANGE FOR THE MILES AWARDED. AIR TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT. THE COMPANY DEFERS THE PORTION OF THE SALES PROCEEDS THAT REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE AIR TRANSPORTATION AND RECOGNIZES THAT AMOUNT AS REVENUE WHEN TRANSPORTATION IS PROVIDED. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AIR TRANSPORTATION COMPONENT IS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE EQUIVALENT TICKET VALUE OF SIMILAR FARES ON UNITED AND AMOUNTS PAID TO OTHER AIRLINES FOR MILES. THE INITIAL REVENUE DEFERRAL IS PRESENTED AS MILEAGE PLUS DEFERRED REVENUE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. WHEN RECOGNIZED THE REVENUE RELATED TO THE AIR TRANSPORTATION COMPONENT IS CLASSIFIED AS PASSENGER REVENUES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. MARKETING-RELATED ELEMENT. THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE FROM THE MARKETING-RELATED ELEMENT IS DETERMINED BY SUBTRACTING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AIR TRANSPORTATION FROM THE TOTAL SALES PROCEEDS. THE RESIDUAL PORTION OF THE SALES PROCEEDS RELATED TO MARKETING ACTIVITIES IS RECOGNIZED WHEN MILES ARE AWARDED. THIS PORTION IS RECOGNIZED AS OTHER OPERATING REVENUES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIODS MILES ARE AWARDED TO CUSTOMERS WHICH IS WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS COMPLETE. THE COMPANY RECEIVED CASH PROCEEDS OF 970 MILLION AND 891 MILLION IN 2007 AND 2006 RESPECTIVELY FOR THE SALE OF MILES TO NON-AIRLINE THIRD PARTIES. WE RECORDED 302 MILLION AND 292 MILLION IN OTHER REVENUE IN 2007 AND 2006 RESPECTIVELY FROM MILES SOLD TO NON-AIRLINE THIRD PARTIES. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF OUR CO-BRANDED CREDIT CARD PARTNER MILES SOLD TO NON-AIRLINE THIRD PARTIES ARE TYPICALLY AWARDED TO CUSTOMERS OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES IN THE SAME PERIOD WHICH RESULTS IN THE RECOGNITION BY THE COMPANY OF OTHER REVENUE FOR THE RESIDUAL MARKETING-RELATED ELEMENT OF THOSE SALES. MILES SOLD TO OUR CO-BRANDED CREDIT CARD PARTNER ARE PURCHASED IN ADVANCE AND ARE AWARDED TO THEIR CUSTOMERS IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. AS NOTED ABOVE THE AIR TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT OF THE MILE IS TRANSFERRED FROM ADVANCE PURCHASE OF MILES TO MILEAGE PLUS DEFERRED REVENUE AND OTHER REVENUE IS RECORDED FOR THE MARKETING-RELATED ELEMENT WHEN THOSE MILES ARE AWARDED TO THE CO-BRANDED PARTNER S CUSTOMERS. THE REVENUE RELATED TO THE AIR TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT IS RECORDED IN FUTURE PERIODS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMPANY S MILEAGE PLUS DEFERRED REVENUE ACCOUNTING POLICY. 10 _________________________________________________________________ NOTE 2(H) MILEAGE PLUS AWARDS 9. PLEASE TELL US WHY YOU BELIEVE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE RELATED TO EXPECTED EXPIRED MILES OVER THE EXPIRATION PERIOD OF THE MILES RATHER THAN UPON EXPIRATION OR IN PROPORTION TO ACTUAL MILEAGE REDEMPTIONS. WHEN WE EXITED BANKRUPTCY IN EARLY 2006 WE ADOPTED FRESH START REPORTING WHICH REQUIRED US TO RECORD OUR MILEAGE PLUS DEFERRED REVENUE OBLIGATION ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE OF EXIT FROM BANKRUPTCY. IN ADDITION AS PART OF FRESH START REPORTING WE ADOPTED A NEW DEFERRED REVENUE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR OUR MILEAGE PLUS FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM. OUR NEW DEFERRED REVENUE ACCOUNTING POLICY ALSO REQUIRED US TO ADOPT AN ACCOUNTING POLICY TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR EXPIRED MILES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS NEW POLICY TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM EXPIRED MILES OVER THE EXPIRATION PERIOD OF THE MILES WAS APPROPRIATE IN 2006 BECAUSE THE EXPIRATION PERIOD REPRESENTED THE COMPANY S BEST ESTIMATE OF THE CUSTOMER REDEMPTION PERIOD FOR THESE MILES. THE COMPANY USED HISTORICAL DATA TO DETERMINE AN ESTIMATED EXPIRATION RATE AND AN ESTIMATED PERIOD FROM WHEN A MILE IS EARNED TO WHEN IT IS USED OR DEACTIVATED ( REDEMPTION PERIOD ). THE AVERAGE REDEMPTION PERIOD APPROXIMATED 36 MONTHS SO THE COMPANY USED THE EXPIRATION PERIOD WHICH WAS ALSO 36 MONTHS TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR MILES EXPECTED TO EXPIRE. THE NUMBER OF MILES REDEEMED OR DEACTIVATED HAS BEEN RELATIVELY CONSISTENT FROM MONTH TO MONTH AND ACCORDINGLY REVENUE WAS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE REDEMPTION PERIOD. IN 2007 WE ANNOUNCED A NEW POLICY THAT MILES IN MILEAGE PLUS ACCOUNTS WITH 18 MONTHS OF INACTIVITY WOULD EXPIRE EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31 2007. ACCORDINGLY WE CHANGED THE EXPIRATION REVENUE RECOGNITION PERIOD TO 18 MONTHS IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR EXISTING ACCOUNTING POLICY. THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT IT SHOULD CONTINUE TO FOLLOW ITS EXISTING ACCOUNTING POLICY DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD FROM ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE NEW POLICY TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE BECAUSE LEAVING THE RECOGNITION PERIOD UNCHANGED AT 36 MONTHS AND THE ESTIMATED EXPIRATION RATE UNCHANGED WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERSTATED THE INCREMENTAL NUMBER OF MILES THAT WOULD SUBSEQUENTLY BE DEACTIVATED DUE TO THE SHORTENED EXPIRATION PERIOD. 10. PLEASE TELL US AND REVISE YOUR POLICY TO DISCLOSE WHETHER YOUR LIABILITY FOR MILES ACCUMULATED BY CUSTOMERS THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF TRAVEL INCLUDES MILES IN PARTICIPANTS ACCOUNTS WHO HAVE NOT YET REACHED MINIMUM LEVELS OF MILEAGE CREDITS NECESSARY FOR AWARDS. THE COMPANY MEASURES ITS DEFERRED REVENUE OBLIGATION USING ALL AWARDED AND OUTSTANDING MILES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE CUSTOMER HAS ACCUMULATED ENOUGH MILES TO REDEEM AN AWARD. EVENTUALLY THESE CUSTOMERS WILL ACCUMULATE ENOUGH MILES TO REDEEM AWARDS OR THEIR ACCOUNTS WILL DEACTIVATE AFTER A PERIOD OF INACTIVITY IN WHICH CASE THE COMPANY WILL RECOGNIZE THE RELATED REVENUE THROUGH ITS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY FOR EXPIRED MILES. 11 _________________________________________________________________ IN FUTURE FILINGS WE WILL UPDATE OUR ACCOUNTING POLICY DISCLOSURE TO PROVIDE THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. 11. WE NOTE THAT IN EARLY 2007 YOU ANNOUNCED A CHANGE IN YOUR POLICY TO CANCEL ALL MILES IN ACCOUNTS THAT WERE INACTIVE FOR 18 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS AS OF DECEMBER 31 2007. PLEASE TELL US HOW YOU ALLOCATED THE 246 MILLION ADJUSTMENT TO EACH OF THE FOUR QUARTERS IN 2007. IN ADDITION PLEASE TELL US WHAT CONSIDERATION YOU GAVE TO CHANGES IN BREAKAGE ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS FOR CUSTOMERS WHO MIGHT ACCELERATE USAGE OF MILES PRIOR TO THE ANNOUNCED EXPIRATION DATE. WHEN WE EXITED BANKRUPTCY IN EARLY 2006 WE ADOPTED FRESH START REPORTING WHICH REQUIRED US TO RECORD OUR MILEAGE PLUS DEFERRED REVENUE OBLIGATION ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE OF EXIT FROM BANKRUPTCY. IN ADDITION AS PART OF FRESH START REPORTING WE ADOPTED A NEW DEFERRED REVENUE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR OUR MILEAGE PLUS FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM. OUR NEW DEFERRED REVENUE ACCOUNTING POLICY ALSO REQUIRED US TO ADOPT AN ACCOUNTING POLICY T
