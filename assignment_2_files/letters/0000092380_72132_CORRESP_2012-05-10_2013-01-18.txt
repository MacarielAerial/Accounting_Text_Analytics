CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT OF A PORTION OF THE RESPONSE TO COMMENT 5 REQUESTED BY SOUTHWEST AIRLINES PURSUANT TO RULE 83 __________________________________________________________________ CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES PAGE 62 FREQUENT FLYER ACCOUNTING PAGE 66 3. WE NOTE YOUR RESPONSE TO PRIOR COMMENT 6. OUR COMMENT WAS WRITTEN WITH A VIEW TO THE FUTURE REGARDING CHANGES TO THE FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM. PLEASE TELL US AND DISCLOSE HOW THE NEW PROGRAM IS ULTIMATELY EXPECTED TO DIFFER FROM THE OLD PROGRAM IN REGARDS TO THE HISTORICAL AMOUNT OF LIABILITY THAT HAS BEEN ACCRUED. ALSO EXPLAIN HOW CHANGES IN THE PROGRAM (NO BLACKOUT DATES ETC.) WILL AFFECT THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ESTIMATING FUTURE LIABILITIES. RESPONSE: THE SIGNIFICANT REVISIONS TO THE COMPANY S FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM WERE UNDERTAKEN WITH THE PRIMARY GOALS OF 1) INCREASING THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS ENROLLED IN THE RAPID REWARDS PROGRAM 2) INCREASING THE LOYALTY OF EXISTING AND NEW PROGRAM MEMBERS THROUGH HIGHER FREQUENCY OF DOING BUSINESS WITH SOUTHWEST AND 3) INCREASING THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS WHO CARRY SOUTHWEST S CO-BRANDED CHASE VISA CREDIT CARD. DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF THE NEW PROGRAM THE COMPANY HAS EXCEEDED ITS INITIAL EXPECTATIONS IN ALL THREE OF THESE AREAS. THEREFORE THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF ACCRUED LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ITS FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM VERSUS THE HISTORICAL AMOUNTS ACCRUED. HOWEVER THE INCREASES NOTED THUS FAR ARE ONLY DUE TO THE NUMBER OF PROGRAM MEMBERS AND THE OVERALL INCREASE IN ACTIVITY IN THE NEW PROGRAM. CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS HAVE NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANY S FREQUENT FLYER LIABILITIES THUS FAR. AS DISCUSSED IN ITS PREVIOUS RESPONSE THE COMPANY HAS CREATED THE NEW PROGRAM IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY RETAINED THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS THAT REDEEM FREQUENT FLYER AWARDS SO THAT REVENUE DISPLACEMENT IS MINIMIZED. THEREFORE THE MAJORITY OF THE OPERATIONAL-TYPE CHANGES IN THE NEW PROGRAM ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON MOST OF THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ESTIMATING FUTURE LIABILITIES. OVERALL THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE PRIMARY ASSUMPTION THAT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON FUTURE LIABILITIES IS THE AMOUNT OF EXPECTED SPOILAGE OF FREQUENT FLYER BENEFITS BY MEMBERS DUE TO THE RULES OF THE NEW PROGRAM. AS SUCH THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO DISCLOSE THAT ACTUAL SPOILAGE MAY DIFFER FROM EXPECTED SPOILAGE IN THE NEW PROGRAM AND WHETHER CHANGES IN ESTIMATES HAVE HAD OR ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANY S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME PAGE 75 4. WE NOTE YOUR RESPONSE TO PRIOR COMMENT 5. WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING A DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF `OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE NOTES TO YOUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD ENHANCE AN INVESTOR S UNDERSTANDING OF THIS SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE LINE ITEM. PLEASE REVISE AS APPROPRIATE. RESPONSE: THE COMPANY PROPOSES TO EXPAND THE DISCLOSURES IN ITS NOTES TO ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FUTURE FILINGS IN THE FOLLOWING WAY TO ADDRESS THE STAFF S REQUEST: OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES CONTAIN DISTRIBUTION COSTS ADVERTISING EXPENSES PERSONNEL EXPENSES PROFESSIONAL FEES AND OTHER OPERATING COSTS NONE OF WHICH INDIVIDUALLY EXCEED 10 OF OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES. AIRCRAFT AND ENGINE MAINTENANCE PAGE 80 5. WE NOTE YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT 8. YOU STATE THE AMENDED CONTRACT ESTABLISHED A MINIMUM DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT THE COMPANY WILL PAY TO GE OVER THE REMAINDER OF THE CONTRACT TERM IN CASE THE NUMBER OF ACTUAL FLIGHT HOURS FALLS BELOW A MINIMUM THRESHOLD. YOU ALSO STATE YOU EXPECT TO EXCEED THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHOP VISITS ALLOWED IN THE AMENDED AGREEMENT. THEREFORE PLEASE TELL US YOUR EXPECTATION WITH REGARD TO THE NEW MINIMUM PAYMENT THRESHOLD NAMELY WHETHER PAYMENT OF ANY SUCH AMOUNTS IS LIKELY AND IF SO THE AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE PAID AND THE BASIS FOR YOUR CONCLUSION AS TO LIKELIHOOD. RESPONSE: THE AMENDED CONTRACT STATES THAT THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO PAY GE A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY WHICH COVERS A MAXIMUM OF 52 SHOP VISITS. THE COMPANY S CURRENT FLIGHT AND MAINTENANCE PLANS ANTICIPATE APPROXIMATELY 113 SHOP VISITS OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE CONTRACT. AS A RESULT WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT ANY AMOUNTS PAID TO GE AND RECORDED AS PREPAYMENTS WILL NOT BE FULLY REALIZED THROUGH MAINTENANCE SHOP VISITS DURING THE REMAINING TERM OF THE AGREEMENT.
