PLEASE NOTE THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF ADDITIONAL COMMENTS WE WILL AMEND OUR FORM 10-K FOR YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2010 WITHIN 2 WEEKS FOLLOWING THE SUBMISSION OF OUR COMMENTS. COMMENT 1. SIGNIFICANCE OF BEING THE ONLY PART 121 START-UP AIRLINE TO HAVE RECEIVED DOT FITNESS APPROVAL. IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT BALTIA HAS SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED TO THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION APPROVED BY THE U.S. PRESIDENT THAT IT POSSESSES THE MANAGEMENT REGULATORY-REQUIRED EMPLOYEES CAPITAL AND EQUIPMENT TO SAFELY AND FINANCIALLY PERFORM ITS PROPOSED BUSINESS PLAN TO ENGAGE IN FOREIGN SCHEDULED AIR TRANSPORTATION OF PERSON PROPERTY AND MAIL. THE DOT FITNESS CERTIFICATE ORDER 2009-3-7 WAS ISSUED ON MARCH 10 2009. DOT FITNESS APPROVAL IS DISTINCT FROM FAA CERTIFICATION I.E. AIR CARRIER CERTIFICATION . UPON RECEIVING FITNESS CERTIFICATION THE CARRIER IS ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR AIR CARRIER CERTIFICATION WHICH INCLUDES FAA APPROVAL OF THE CARRIER S AIRCRAFT AND FAA ISSUANCE OF CARRIER S OPERATING SPECIFICATIONS. FAA CERTIFICATION IS A PREREQUISITE TO COMMENCING OPERATIONS PURSUANT TO THE DOT CERTIFICATION. COMMENT 2. QUESTION CONCERNING PRIOR EFFORTS TO OBTAIN CERTIFICATION BALTIA RECEIVED DOT FITNESS APPROVAL IN 1990 AND INITIATED AIR CARRIER CERTIFICATION WITH THE FAA. UNFORTUNATELY THE USSR DISINTEGRATED CAUSED BALTIA TO STOP CERTIFICATION. THERE IS LITTLE IF ANY SIGNIFICANCE IN THE FACT THAT BALTIA HAD INITIATED FAA CERTIFICATION 20 YEARS AGO WHERE THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS HAS BEEN MODIFIED. HOWEVER IF THE SEC BELIEVES OTHERWISE BALTIA SUGGESTS INCLUDING THE BELOW LANGUAGE AND WILL AWAIT A RESPONSE FROM THE SEC. TWENTY YEARS AGO BALTIA WAS AUTHORIZED TO PROVIDE INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORTATION AND BEGAN THE NEXT STEP AIR CARRIER CERTIFICATION. ALL WAS STOPPED AS A RESULT OF THE USSR DISINTEGRATION AND BALTIA REAPPLIED FOR AIR CARRIER CERTIFICATION IN 2010. COMMENT 3. SAFE HARBOR REFERENCES.
