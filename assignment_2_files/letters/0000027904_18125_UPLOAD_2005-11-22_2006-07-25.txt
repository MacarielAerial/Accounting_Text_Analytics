FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2004 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT`S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PAGE 25 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS PAGE 40 PENSION FUNDING PAGES 41 1. WE BELIEVE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING THE DISCLOSURE TO DISCUSS ANY REASONABLY EXPECTED CHANGES IN THE PENSION SYSTEMS THAT MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANY`S LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AMONG OTHER MATTERS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER LEGISLATIVE MEASURES THAT MAY REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO: (I) PAY HIGHER PREMIUMS PER PARTICIPANT PER YEAR TO THE GOVERNMENT`S PENSION INSURANCE AGENCY (I.E. PBGC) (II) STRENGTHEN THE AMOUNT TO FUND THEIR TRADITIONAL PLANS TO LESSEN THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY ASSUMED BY THE PBGC FOR FAILED COMPANIES AND (III) CHANGE THE FORMULA FOR WHICH PENSION LIABILITIES ARE CALCULATED. YOUR DISCUSSION SHOULD INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED RANGE OF KNOWN IMPACT IF THERE IS ENACTMENT FOR EACH OF THESE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES PAGE 43 PENSION PLANS PAGE 44 2. DISCLOSURES IN NOTE 12 HIGHLIGHT THE HIGHLY MATERIAL IMPACT THAT THE ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT HAD ON OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND STOCKHOLDERS` EQUITY DURING THE THREE-YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PERIOD. IN VIEW OF THE (I) MATERIAL DEFICIENCY IN FUNDED STATUS IN YOUR DEFINED PENSION PLAN (II) THE AMOUNT OF MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY RECOGNIZED IN THE THREE-YEAR FINANCIAL PERIOD AND (III) ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ON THIS RETIREMENT OBLIGATION REPRESENTING A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY WE BELIEVE YOU SHOULD EXPAND THE MD A TO ALSO DISCLOSE THE INDIVIDUAL IMPACT ON THE FUNDED STATUS (I.E. FAIR MARKET VALUE OF PENSION ASSETS - PRESENT VALUE OF PENSION LIABILITIES (PBO)) OF PENSION PLAN AND SHAREHOLDERS` EQUITY ADJUSTMENT (I.E. ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY) FOR THE HYPOTHETICAL BASIS CHANGES IN EACH OF THE ESTIMATES (I.E. WEIGHTED AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE RATE OF FUTURE COMPENSATION LEVELS AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN) AS WELL THE AGGREGATE IMPACT ON THESE TWO ITEMS FOR CHANGES ON ALL OF THE ESTIMATES. WE ALSO SUGGEST THAT YOU SET FORTH THE ABOVE DATA AS WELL AS THE PENSION EXPENSE IMPACT DATA CURRENTLY BEING DISCLOSED IN TABULAR FORMAT FOR EASE OF ANALYSIS AND UNDERSTANDING BY INVESTORS. FURTHERMORE FROM DISCLOSURE IN NOTE 10 PAGE F-42 WE NOTE THE FOLLOWING PERCENTAGE CHANGES THAT OCCURRED IN YOUR ESTIMATES OF THE THREE ASSUMPTIONS DURING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT PERIOD: A 1 3/4 CHANGE IN WEIGHTED AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE A 3 CHANGE IN EXPECTED RATE OF INCREASE IN FUTURE COMPENSATION LEVELS AND A 1 CHANGE IN EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS. THEREFORE IT APPEARS DISCLOSURES ON THE IMPACT (I.E. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS) BASED ON 1 CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES RATHER THAN THE 1/2 CURRENTLY BEING DISCLOSED WOULD BE MORE RELEVANT AND REASONABLE UNDER YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES. PLEASE REVISE ACCORDINGLY. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS PAGE F-3 3. REFERENCE IS MADE TO OTHER NONCURRENT ASSETS THAT APPROXIMATED 1.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31 2004. WE SUGGEST YOU PROVIDE EXPANDED DISCLOSURE IN A NOTE THAT DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THE SIGNIFICANT ITEMS IN THIS CAPTION INCLUDING AN ACCOUNTING POLICY THERETO. WITH RESPECT TO ANY SIGNIFICANT DEFERRED CHARGES STATE THE POLICY FOR DEFERRAL AND AMORTIZATION. NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES PAGE F-8 GOODWILL INTANGIBLE ASSETS PAGE F-15 4. IN EVALUATING IMPAIRMENT FOR GOODWILL YOU DISCLOSE THAT YOU CONSIDER PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS WHILE THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED ASSETS IS BASED ON PROJECTED DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. IT APPEARS THAT YOUR TREATMENT IS NOT CONSISTENT IN APPLYING THE SIMILAR FAIR VALUE BASED IMPAIRMENT TESTS REQUIRED FOR INDEFINITE (NON-AMORTIZABLE) LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL. REFER TO THE GUIDANCE IN FOOTNOTE 12 PARAGRAPHS 23-25 AND PARAGRAPHS 88-89 OF SFAS NO. 142. PLEASE ADVISE AND REVISE AS APPROPRIATE. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PAGES F-17 5. DURING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT PERIOD WE NOTE THAT YOUR ASSUMPTIONS OF EXPECTED VOLATILITY ON COMMON STOCK SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED FROM APPROXIMATELY 40 TO 70 WHILE YOUR AVERAGE EXPECTED LIFE OF STOCK OPTIONS CHANGED FROM APPROXIMATELY 7 YEARS TO 3 YEARS. YOU ALSO DISCLOSE THAT SFAS NO. 123(R) MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT UPON ITS ADOPTION. ON AVERAGE ONE WOULD GENERALLY EXPECT THAT EMPLOYEES MAY TEND TO EXERCISE OPTIONS ON HIGHLY VOLATILE STOCK EARLIER THAN ON STOCKS WITH LOWER VOLATILITY. HOWEVER IT IS UNCLEAR OF THE FACTORS OR CONDITIONS YOU CONSIDERED IN ESTIMATING THE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT 4 YEAR CHANGE IN EXPECTED LIFE OF YOUR STOCK OPTIONS AS A RESULT OF AN APPROXIMATE 30 CHANGE IN EXPECTED VOLATILITY. IN THIS REGARD IN VIEW OF THE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY INCLUDING YOUR RECENT BANKRUPTCY FILING IT WOULD APPEAR THAT AN INCREASE IN VOLATILITY OF THE STOCK MAY NOT RESULT IN SUCH A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE OPTION. ALSO AS YOUR STOCK OPTIONS BECOME EXERCISABLE ONE TO FIVE YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE (SEE NOTE 11 - PAGE F-45) PLEASE TELL US WHETHER THE THREE-YEAR AVERAGE EXPECTED LIFE IS BASED ON THE AVERAGE OF THE EARLIEST PERIOD IN WHICH YOUR STOCK OPTIONS CAN BE EXERCISABLE. IN ADDITION AS THE APPROXIMATE 4-YEAR REDUCTION IN THE AVERAGE EXPECTED LIFE WAS RECOGNIZED IN FISCAL 2003 PLEASE ADVISE WHETHER YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN EXERCISE ON THE OPTIONS THAT HAD SHORTER (I.E. ONE TO TWO YEAR) EXERCISE PERIODS. PLEASE RE-EVALUATE THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND ADDRESS IN COMPLETE AND CLEAR DETAIL YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE ABOVE MATTERS IN ESTIMATING THE SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD CHANGE RECOGNIZED IN THE AVERAGE EXPECTED LIFE OF STOCK OPTIONS IN COMPUTING THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH OPTIONS. NOTE 6. DEBT PAGE F-23 DEBT EXCHANGES AND PURCHASES PAGE F-28 6. WE NOTE IN NOVEMBER 2004 YOU EXCHANGED 237 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF YOUR 7.78 SERIES 2000-1C ENHANCED EQUIPMENT TRUST CERTIFICATES DUE 2005 AND 7.30 SERIES 2001-1C ENHANCED EQUIPMENT TRUST CERTIFICATES DUE 2006 FOR 235 MILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF NEWLY ISSUED 9.5 SENIOR SECURED NOTES DUE 2008. PLEASE TELL US AND REVISE FUTURE FILINGS TO EXPLAIN WHETHER THIS EXCHANGE RESULTED IN ANY GAIN OR LOSS RECOGNITION AND IF SO WHERE SUCH AMOUNTS ARE REFLECTED IN YOUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF NO GAIN OR LOSS RECOGNITION WAS REQUIRED PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY. 7. WE NOTE THAT YOU COMPLETED AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN AIRCRAFT LENDERS TO DEFER 112 MILLION IN DEBT OBLIGATIONS FROM 2004 THROUGH 2006 TO LATER YEARS. IN THIS REGARD PLEASE TELL US WHETHER THE DEFERRAL IS CONSIDERED A SUBSTANTIAL MODIFICATION IN TERMS (I.E. CHANGE IN MATURITY) WHICH SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER EITF NO. 96- 19. IF SO PLEASE TELL US HOW YOUR ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF SUCH MODIFICATION COMPLIES WITH THE GUIDANCE OUTLINED IN EITF NO. 96- 19. IF YOU BELIEVE EITF NO. 96-19 DOES NOT APPLY PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY. NOTE 9. INCOME TAXES PAGE F-37 8. PLEASE REVISE FUTURE FILINGS TO DISCLOSE THE DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN COMPONENTS OF YOUR PRE-TAX EARNINGS (LOSSES). REFER TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 4-08(H) OF REGULATION S-X.
