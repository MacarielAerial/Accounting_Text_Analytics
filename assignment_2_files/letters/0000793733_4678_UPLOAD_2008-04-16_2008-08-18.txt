WE ASK YOU TO REVISE FUTURE FILINGS IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THESE COMMENTS. IF YOU DISAGREE WE WILL CONSIDER YOUR EXPLANATION AS TO WHY A REVISION IS UNNECESSARY. PLEASE BE AS DETAILED AS NECESSARY IN YOUR EXPLANATION. WE ALSO ASK YOU TO PROVIDE US WITH INFORMATION SO WE MAY BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR DISCLOSURE. AFTER REVIEWING THIS INFORMATION WE MAY RAISE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. THE PURPOSE OF OUR REVIEW PROCESS IS TO ASSIST YOU IN YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AND TO ENHANCE THE OVERALL DISCLOSURE IN YOUR FILINGS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THESE RESPECTS AND WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS. FEEL FREE TO CALL US AT THE TELEPHONE NUMBERS LISTED AT THE END OF THIS LETTER. PLEASE FILE YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR COMMENTS VIA EDGAR UNDER THE LABEL CORRESP WITHIN TEN BUSINESS DAYS FROM THE DATE OF THIS LETTER. FORM 10-K: FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2007 ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA PAGE 32 1. IN FUTURE FILINGS PLEASE PROVIDE SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA FOR EACH FULL QUARTER WITHIN THE TWO MOST RECENT FISCAL YEARS. REFER TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF ITEM 302(A)(1) OF REGULATION S-K. SKYWEST INC. APRIL 16 2008 PAGE 2 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AIRCRAFT LEASES PAGE 35 2. WE NOTE THAT YOU ARE A PARTY TO 287 AIRCRAFT LEASES ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES BASED UPON CERTAIN ESTIMATES REGARDING THE ECONOMIC USEFUL LIVES AND THE FAIR VALUES OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS. HOWEVER WE ALSO NOTE FROM YOUR DISCLOSURE IN THE RISK FACTOR SECTION OF YOUR FILING (I.E. PAGE 18) THAT YOUR AIRCRAFT LEASES HAVE REMAINING TERMS RANGING FROM ONE TO 18 YEARS. GIVEN THAT FOOTNOTE 1 TO YOUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INDICATES THAT AIRCRAFT AND ROTABLE SPARES ARE DEPRECIATED OVER A USEFUL LIFE OF 10 TO 18 YEARS IT APPEARS THAT THE TERMS OF CERTAIN OF YOUR AIRCRAFT LEASE AGREEMENTS MAY HAVE BEEN EQUIVALENT TO OR EXCEEDED 75 OF THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE LEASED PROPERTY (AS DEFINED IN PARAGRAPH 5(G) OF SFAS NO. 13). IN THIS REGARD PLEASE TELL US HOW YOU HAVE DETERMINED THAT NONE OF YOUR AIRCRAFT LEASES SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS CAPITAL LEASES PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH 7(C) OF SFAS NO. 13. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PAGE 36 3. WE NOTE YOUR PRESENTATION OF PASSENGER BREAKEVEN LOAD FACTOR AND YIELD PER REVENUE PASSENGER MILE. GIVEN THAT 98 OF YOUR ASMS WERE GENERATED BY YOUR CONTRACT-RATE FLYING REVENUES FROM WHICH APPEAR TO BE LARGELY UNRELATED TO THE ACTUAL VOLUME OF PASSENGERS CARRIED IT IS NOT CLEAR WHY PASSENGER BREAKEVEN LOAD FACTOR OR YIELD PER REVENUE PASSENGER MILE IS RELEVANT OR USEFUL TO YOUR INVESTORS. PLEASE REVISE TO ELIMINATE THESE DISCLOSURES OR ADVISE AS APPROPRIATE. 4. WE NOTE THAT YOUR PASSENGER REVENUES ARE COMPRISED OF VARIOUS COMPONENTS SUCH AS CONTRACT-RATE PAYMENTS WHICH INCLUDE REIMBURSEMENT OF CONTROLLABLE AND PASS-THROUGH COSTS AND A MARGIN COMPONENT AND PRO-RATE AMOUNTS. WE ALSO NOTE THAT CERTAIN EXPENSE CATEGORIES ARE IMPACTED BY COST REIMBURSEMENTS. TO MORE CLEARLY PRESENT THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN THESE REVENUE COMPONENTS ON YOUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WE BELIEVE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER SEPARATE DISCLOSURE OF THESE AMOUNTS PREFERABLY IN A TABLE. IN ADDITION PLEASE CONSIDER DETAILING THE RELATED COST CATEGORIES TO SHOW THE EFFECTS OF REIMBURSEMENTS (FOR EXAMPLE GROSS FUEL COST FUEL REIMBURSEMENTS AND A SUB-TOTAL FOR NET FUEL COST). 5. THE COST CATEGORIES INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ON PAGE 38 DIFFER FROM THOSE PRESENTED ON YOUR INCOME STATEMENT. WHILE WE UNDERSTAND FROM YOUR DISCLOSURE THAT MAINTENANCE EXPENSE ON PAGE 38 EXCLUDES SALARIES WAGES AND BENEFITS IT IS NOT CLEAR WHY YOU PRESENT THESE PERSONNEL COSTS DIFFERENTLY HERE. IT IS ALSO NOT CLEAR WHY OTHER COST CATEGORIES ARE PRESENTED DIFFERENTLY FROM THE INCOME STATEMENT. AS THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PORTION OF MD A IS INTENDED TO DISCUSS AND ANALYZE THE LINE ITEMS FROM THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PLEASE REVISE YOUR PRESENTATION HERE SKYWEST INC. APRIL 16 2008 PAGE 3 AND ON THE INCOME STATEMENT TO BE ON A CONSISTENT BASIS. WHEN DETERMINING THE BASIS ON WHICH YOU CHOSE TO PRESENT INCOME STATEMENT LINE ITEMS IN THE FUTURE PLEASE EVALUATE THE CONSISTENCY OF PRESENTING INFORMATION BY FUNCTION OR BY NATURE AS YOUR CURRENT PRESENTATION APPEARS TO BE PARTIALLY BY FUNCTION (E.G. AIRCRAFT COSTS AND MAINTENANCE) AND PARTIALLY BY NATURE (E.G. SALARIES WAGES AND BENEFITS AND FUEL). NOTWITHSTANDING YOUR CONFORMING OF THE INCOME STATEMENT AND MD A WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAIL ON SUB-CATEGORIES OF COSTS IN MD A TO THE EXTENT MATERIAL AND USEFUL TO INVESTORS. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU CHOSE TO PRESENT MAINTENANCE EXPENSE INCLUDING SALARIES WAGES AND BENEFITS AND BELIEVE DISCUSSION OF SALARIES WAGES AND BENEFITS ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS WOULD ALSO BE USEFUL WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO DISCUSS AND ANALYZE IT SUPPLEMENTALLY WITH APPROPRIATE DISCLOSURE INDICATING THAT THE COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN VARIOUS INCOME STATEMENT LINE ITEMS. 6. YOU DISCUSS AND ANALYZE OPERATING COSTS PRIMARILY ON A PER ASM BASIS. HOWEVER CERTAIN OF YOUR OPERATING COSTS ARE NOT DRIVEN BY ASMS. FOR EXAMPLE AIRCRAFT COSTS ARE DRIVEN BY FLEET SIZE RENTAL RATES AND PURCHASE PRICES MAINTENANCE COSTS ARE LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE TIMING AND COST OF MAINTENANCE EVENTS AND INTEREST COSTS ARE DRIVEN BY PRINCIPLE BALANCES AND BORROWING RATES. WHILE WE DO NOT OBJECT TO SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF COST PER ASM SUCH AS THAT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ON PAGE 38 WE DO NOT BELIEVE YOUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF NON ASM-DRIVEN COST CATEGORIES SHOULD BE ON AN ASM BASIS. INSTEAD YOUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE BASED ON THE FACTORS ACTUALLY AFFECTING SPECIFIC COST CATEGORIES. PLEASE REVIEW ALL OF YOUR COST CATEGORIES AND REVISE TO ENSURE DISCLOSURE IS FOCUSED ON ACTUAL COST DRIVERS. 7. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF YOUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DISCLOSURE IS DEDICATED TO STATING IN NARRATIVE TEXT FORM DOLLAR AND PERCENTAGE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTS SOME OF WHICH IS ALREADY INCLUDED IN TABLES. IN ADDITION WHILE YOU DISCUSS CERTAIN FACTORS TO WHICH CHANGES ARE ATTRIBUTABLE YOU DO NOT QUANTIFY A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE FACTORS NOR ANALYZE THE UNDERLYING BUSINESS REASONS FOR THE CHANGES. FOR EXAMPLE OTHER AIRLINE EXPENSES INCREASED IN 2007 BUT YOU DO NOT QUANTIFY THE FACTORS CAUSING THE INCREASE NOR ANALYZE THE UNDERLYING REASONS FOR THE CHANGE. WE BELIEVE YOUR DISCLOSURES COULD BE IMPROVED AND MADE MUCH MORE USER-FRIENDLY AND CLEAR BY: INCREASING THE USE OF TABLES TO PRESENT DOLLAR AND PERCENTAGE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTS RATHER THAN INCLUDING SUCH INFORMATION IN NARRATIVE TEXT FORM USING TABLES TO LIST QUANTIFY AND SUM ALL OF THE MATERIAL INDIVIDUAL FACTORS TO WHICH CHANGES IN ACCOUNTS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE REFOCUSING THE NARRATIVE TEXT PORTION OF THE DISCLOSURE ON ANALYSIS OF THE UNDERLYING BUSINESS REASONS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL FACTORS IN THE TABLES ABOVE ENSURING THAT ALL MATERIAL FACTORS ARE QUANTIFIED AND ANALYZED AND QUANTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN BOTH PRICE AND VOLUME ON REVENUES AND EXPENSE CATEGORIES WHERE APPROPRIATE. SKYWEST INC. APRIL 16 2008 PAGE 4 SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS PAGE 43 8. AS THE TABLE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS IS INTENDED TO INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY OF CASH FLOW WE BELIEVE THAT REGISTRANTS SHOULD GENERALLY INCLUDE SCHEDULED INTEREST PAYMENTS IN THE TABLE. WHERE INTEREST RATES ARE VARIABLE AND UNKNOWN YOU MAY USE YOUR JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF YOUR INTEREST PAYMENTS. IF YOU ELECT TO INCLUDE ESTIMATED INTEREST PAYMENTS YOU MAY DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE METHODOLOGY TO ESTIMATE SUCH AMOUNTS. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU INCLUDE INTEREST PAYMENTS OR NOT A FOOTNOTE TO THE TABLE SHOULD CLARIFY WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE DONE SO AND IF APPLICABLE THE METHODOLOGY YOU HAVE USED TO ESTIMATE SUCH AMOUNTS. TO THE EXTENT INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE TABLE WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO DISCLOSE THE SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE DEBT AS WELL AS ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT IS MATERIAL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THESE FUTURE CASH FLOWS. IN FUTURE FILINGS PLEASE I) REVISE YOUR TABLE TO REFLECT THE EXPECTED CASH OUTFLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR FUTURE INTEREST PAYMENTS OR II) INCLUDE A FOOTNOTE TO YOUR TABLE THAT PROVIDES SUFFICIENT INFORMATION REGARDING THE INTEREST RATES ATTRIBUTABLE TO YOUR DEBT SUCH THAT AN INVESTOR CAN ASSESS THE CASH FLOW IMPACT OF YOUR FUTURE INTEREST PAYMENTS.
