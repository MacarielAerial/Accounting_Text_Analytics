AUGUST 21 2006 PAGE 2 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2005 ESTIMATED LOSSES ON SUBLEASED AIRCRAFT PAGE 56 1. PLEASE REFER TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT 4. ALTHOUGH WE NOTE YOUR RESPONSE WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT SINCE THE TIME OF MESABA S BANKRUPTCY THE AMOUNTS YOU EXPECT TO RECOVER FROM MESABA NO LONGER REPRESENT SUBLEASE INCOME BUT A POSSIBLE GAIN CONTINGENCY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY OR MAY NOT RECEIVE AS AN UNSECURED CREDITOR IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. IT APPEARS AS THOUGH THE AMOUNT OF UNRECORDED LIABILITY ON THE BALANCE SHEET OF 7.5 MILLION IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. HOWEVER THAT AMOUNT RECORDED AS INCOME OR NETTED AGAINST THE BANKRUPTCY LOSSES IS SOMEWHAT SIGNIFICANT WITH REGARDS TO NET INCOME. PLEASE REVISE YOUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO REFLECT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY WITHOUT REGARD TO THE AMOUNTS THAT MAY POSSIBLY BE RECOVERED IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. ALTERNATIVELY EXPLAIN WHY YOU BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE YOU COULD OBTAIN SUBLEASE RENTALS OF 7.5 MILLION RELATED TO THE LEASED PROPERTY. 2. IN A RELATED MATTER PLEASE RECONCILE THE AMOUNTS FROM YOUR RESPONSE OF AN 8.1 MILLION LOSS AT DECEMBER 31 2005 WITH 10.1 MILLION DISCLOSED ON PAGE 8 OF YOUR JUNE 30 2006 10-Q. SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE AMOUNTS NETTED AGAINST THE LOSS FOR THE EXPECTED RECOVERY AT DECEMBER 31 2005. QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31 2006 NOTE 2. NORTHWEST AND MESABA BANKRUPTCY FILINGS PAGE 5 3. WE NOTE YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT 8 AND REQUIRE FURTHER INFORMATION. PLEASE PROVIDE US WITH THE JOURNAL ENTRIES POSTED INCLUDING THE ORIGINAL ENTRIES TO RECORD THE 1 778 PAYABLE TO NORTHWEST AND SUBSEQUENT RELATED ENTRIES. PLEASE CLARIFY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 1 778 THAT YOU THOUGHT APPROPRIATE TO OFFSET AGAINST NORTHWEST RECEIVABLES WITH THE 1 565 REDUCTION IN THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ALLOWANCE. TELL US WHAT OTHER EVIDENCE OTHER THAN MINIMAL DIRECT BILLINGS BY THESE VENDORS LED YOU TO BELIEVE YOU WOULD NOT OWE CERTAIN AMOUNTS TO NORTHWEST. EXPLAIN TO US IF YOU RECEIVED FURTHER INFORMATION THAT NORTHWEST HAD INDEED PAID THESE VENDORS PRIOR TO FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY OR IF THERE WAS SOME UPDATE DURING THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS THAT INDICATED THESE VENDORS WOULD NOT SEEK PAYMENT DIRECTLY FROM PINNACLE.
