PLEASE TELL US AND REVISE YOUR FINANCIAL STATEMENT DISCLOSURES IN FUTURE FILINGS TO ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING MATTERS WITH RESPECT TO THE REVISED ASA WITH NORTHWEST AND THE RELATED AGREEMENTS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4 TO YOUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: WE NOTE THE DISCLOSURE INDICATING THAT ON JANUARY 3 2007 THE COMPANY AGREED TO ASSIGN AN AGGREGATE OF 335 000 OF ITS 377 500 STIPULATED UNSECURED CLAIM TO SEVERAL THIRD PARTIES FOR AGGREGATE PROCEEDS OF 282 900 NET OF EXPENSES. WE ALSO NOTE THAT BECAUSE THE TOTAL UNSECURED CLAIM WAS INTENDED TO COMPENSATE THE COMPANY FOR PRE-PETITION ACCOUNT RECEIVABLES AND FOREGONE FUTURE EARNINGS UNDER THE 2002 ASA THE COMPANY IS RECOGNIZING THE 271 900 FAIR VALUE OF ITS STIPULATED UNSECURED CLAIM IN EXCESS OF THE 42 900 PRE-PETITION RECEIVABLES OVER THE 11-YEAR TERM OF THE ASA. WE FURTHER NOTE THAT BECAUSE THE PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASED FOR 20 000 IN CONNECTION WITH THESE AGREEMENTS WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE NOMINAL VALUE THE COMPANY REDUCED THE DEFERRED ASA REVENUE BY THE PRESENT VALUE OF THIS OBLIGATION. IN THIS REGARD PLEASE EXPLAIN THE FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 282 900 OF NET PROCEEDS AND THE 271 900 FAIR VALUE OF UNSECURED CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF THE PRE-PETITION RECEIVABLES. ALSO PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY THE NET AMOUNT OF THE 271 900 OF EXCESS UNSECURED CLAIMS AND THE 20 000 PAYMENT FOR THE PREFERRED STOCK OR 251 900 DOES NOT AGREE TO THE AMOUNT REFLECTED IN THE TABLE ON PAGE 61 ON THE LINE ITEM PROCEEDS FROM SALE OF UNSECURED CLAIM OF 253 042.

PLEASE TELL US AND EXPLAIN IN THE DISCLOSURES IN YOUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MARKET VALUE OF THESE SHARES AND THEIR PURCHASE PRICE WAS REFLECTED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE DEFERRED REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REVISED ASA OF 271 900 SIMILAR TO THE 20 000 PURCHASE PRICE PAID TO NORTHWEST FOR THE PREFERRED STOCK. IF THE REPURCHASE OF THESE COMMON SHARES WAS NOT CONSIDERED ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REVISED ASA PLEASE EXPLAIN YOUR BASIS FOR THIS CONCLUSION. MR. PHILIP TRENARY CEO PINNACLE AIRLINES CORP. MAY 1 2008 PAGE 5 WE NOTE THE DISCLOSURE INDICATING THAT THE COMPANY SOLD THE FINAL 42 500 OF ITS UNSECURED CLAIM AGAINST NORTHWEST TO GOLDMAN SACHS CREDIT PARTNERS L.P. FOR A NET PURCHASE PRICE OF 27 731 ON JUNE 29 2007. WE ALSO NOTE THAT THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A NONOPERATING LOSS ON THE SALE OF THIS CLAIM OF 4 144 WHICH REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 31 875 FAIR VALUE OF THE CLAIM AS OF MARCH 31 2007 AND GOLDMAN SACH S PURCHASE PRICE OF 27 731. IF THE PRE-PETITION RECEIVABLES FROM NORTHWEST HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ADJUSTED TO THEIR FAIR VALUE AS YOUR DISCLOSURES APPEAR TO IMPLY PLEASE INDICATE WHEN ANY PROVISION TO REFLECT THE RECEIVABLE AT FAIR VALUE HAD BEEN RECOGNIZED AND WHERE IT IS PRESENTED IN THE COMPANY S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

PLEASE TELL US WHY YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE RESERVED SUFFICIENTLY FOR THIS EXPOSURE GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL IRS ADJUSTMENTS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 14.
