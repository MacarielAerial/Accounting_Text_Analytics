FORM 10-K FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2004 FILED MARCH 16 2005 FILE NO. 0-5368 DEAR MR. FOTI: WE HAVE RECEIVED YOUR NOVEMBER 2 2005 LETTER REGARDING YOUR REVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES CONTAINED IN THE ABOVE REFERENCED SEC FILING FOR ABX AIR INC. (THE COMPANY ). OUR RESPONSE TO YOUR COMMENTS IS PROVIDED BELOW. COMMENT 1: RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PAGE 19 SEC COMMENT: ON PAGE 17 YOU STATE THAT DEPRECIATION AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES ARE NOT REIMBURSABLE BY DHL FOR THE AIRCRAFT NOT IN SERVICE FOR DHL. IN VIEW OF THE HIGHLY MATERIAL 601 MILLION IMPAIRMENT (WRITE-OFF) OF AIRCRAFT AND ITS RELATED PARTS AND EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS THE 184 MILLION TRANSFER OF PROPERTY EQUIPMENT UPON THE SEPARATION FROM AIRBORNE IN AUGUST 2003 IT IS UNCLEAR HOW MUCH OF THESE LONG-LIVED ASSETS WERE NOT IN SERVICE FOR DHL AT THE DATE OF SEPARATION. FOR THE ASSETS NOT IN SERVICE AND THEREFORE UNREIMBURSABLE BY DHL FOR ITS DEPRECIATION AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ON A POST-SEPARATION BASIS IS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE EXCLUSION OF DEPRECIATION AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES PREVIOUSLY INCURRED ON THESE ASSETS WRITTEN-OFF OR TRANSFERRED AT THE SEPARATION DATE. PLEASE TELL US AND EXPAND THE ANNUAL COMPARISON DATA TO DISCLOSE AS APPROPRIATE THE AMOUNT OF THE (I) 785 MILLION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS NOT IN SERVICE BY DHL AT THE DATE OF IMPAIRMENT AND TRANSFER AND (II) FAVORABLE IMPACT ON THE POST-SEPARATION RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE EXCLUSION OF DEPRECIATION AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE INCURRED ON A HISTORICAL BASIS PRIOR TO THE WRITE-OFF AND TRANSFER OF THESE ASSETS. COMPANY RESPONSE TO COMMENT 1: THE COMPANY RECORDED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 144 AS DESCRIBED ON PAGE 16 FOR THE 2004 FORM 10-K. ON AUGUST 15 2003 THE DATE OF THE IMPAIRMENT ALL OF THE COMPANY S ASSETS WERE IN SERVICE WITH AIRBORNE INC. ______________________________________________________________________ ( AIRBORNE ) WHICH HAD JUST BEEN ACQUIRED BY DHL HOLDINGS (USA) INC. ( DHL ). IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE COMPANY S SEPARATION FROM AIRBORNE ON AUGUST 15 2003 ALL OF THE COMPANY S DEPRECIATION EXPENSE WAS BEING CHARGED TO AIRBORNE/DHL UNDER THE COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS. PRIOR TO THE COMPANY S SEPARATION FROM AIRBORNE ALL DEPRECIATION AND HEAVY MAINTENANCE EXPENSES WERE CHARGED AGAINST THE AIRBORNE BUSINESS. BETWEEN AUGUST 15 2003 AND DECEMBER 31 2004 ALL DEPRECIATION AND HEAVY MAINTENANCE EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE COMPANY WERE CHARGED TO DHL UNDER THE COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY DID NOT CHARGE DEPRECIATION AND HEAVY MAINTENANCE EXPENSES AGAINST THE NON-AIRBORNE BUSINESS THE COMPANY DID NOT EXPERIENCE A FAVORABLE IMPACT ON ITS POST-SEPARATION NON-DHL RESULTS AS A RESULT OF THE WRITE-OFF AND TRANSFER OF ASSETS. THE COMPANY WILL DISCLOSE THIS FACT IN FUTURE FILINGS WHEN COMPARING NON-DHL RESULTS AMONG PRE-SEPARATION AND POST-SEPARATION PERIODS. COMMENT 2: PENSION PLANS PAGE 25 SEC COMMENT: IN VIEW OF THE (I) MATERIAL DEFICIENCY IN FUNDED STATUS IN YOUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN AS PRESENTED IN NOTE I - PAGE 56 (II) AMOUNT OF MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY RECOGNIZED IN FISCAL 2004 THAT APPROXIMATED 20 OF NET EARNINGS AND (III) ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ON THIS RETIREMENT OBLIGATION REPRESENTING A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY WE BELIEVE YOU SHOULD EXPAND THE MD A TO ALSO DISCLOSE THE INDIVIDUAL IMPACT ON THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE PENSION PLAN AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY ADJUSTMENT (I.E.

INTEREST ON FIXED RATE OBLIGATIONS SHOULD BE INCLUDED AT A MINIMUM. IF INTEREST ON ANY OBLIGATIONS IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE RELIABLY ESTIMATED PLEASE DISCLOSE THIS FACT AND STATE THE AMOUNTS AND SIGNIFICANT TERMS OF THOSE OBLIGATIONS IN AN ACCOMPANYING FOOTNOTE TO THE TABLE.

COMMENT 6: NOTE B - SPARE PARTS INVENTORY PAGE 44 SEC COMMENT: FROM DISCLOSURE IN SCHEDULE II - PAGE 70 WE NOTE THE PROVISION FOR OBSOLESCENCE ON INVENTORY HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT IN THE LAST TWO FISCAL YEARS. PLEASE TELL US AND EXPAND YOUR ACCOUNTING POLICY TO DESCRIBE IN MORE DETAIL THE METHODOLOGY IN ESTIMATING THIS RESERVE. PLEASE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS HOW OFTEN MANAGEMENT ANALYSES THIS RESERVE FOR REASONABLENESS THE PROCEDURES USED IN ESTIMATING INVENTORY EXPECTED TO BE ON HAND AS WELL AS THE EVENTS OR CONDITIONS (E.G. CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY ETC.) THAT MAY WARRANT CHANGES TO THESE AMOUNTS OR THE ANTICIPATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET. COMPANY RESPONSE TO COMMENT 6: THE COMPANY S INVENTORY IS COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF EXPENDABLE SPARE PARTS AND SUPPLIES USED FOR INTERNAL CONSUMPTION. THESE ITEMS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED TO EXPENSE WHEN ISSUED FOR USE. AS DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPHS 3.123 AND 3.124 OF THE AICPA S INDUSTRY AUDIT GUIDE AUDITS OF AIRLINES THE COMPANY RECORDS AN OBSOLESCENCE RESERVE ON A BASE STOCK OF INVENTORY FOR EACH FLEET TYPE. INVENTORY AMORTIZATION FOR THE OBSOLESCENCE RESERVE CORRESPONDS TO THE EXPECTED LIFE OF EACH 4 ______________________________________________________________________ FLEET TYPE. ADDITIONALLY THE COMPANY MONITORS THE USAGE RATES OF INVENTORY PARTS AND SEGREGATES PARTS THAT ARE TECHNOLOGICALLY OUTDATED OR NO LONGER USED IN ITS FLEET TYPES. SLOW MOVING AND SEGREGATED ITEMS ARE ACTIVELY MARKETED AND WRITTEN DOWN TO THEIR ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUES BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS. MANAGEMENT ANALYZES THE INVENTORY RESERVE FOR REASONABLENESS AT THE END OF EACH CALENDAR QUARTER. THAT ANALYSIS INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF THE EXPECTED FLEET LIFE AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE ON HAND AT THE END OF A FLEET LIFE AND RECENT EVENTS AND CONDITIONS THAT MAY IMPACT THE USABILITY OR VALUE OF INVENTORY. EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT MAY IMPACT THE EXPECTED LIFE USABILITY OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF INVENTORY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE DIRECTIVES FROM THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION CHANGES IN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION REGULATIONS NEW ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. IN FUTURE FORM 10-K FILINGS THE COMPANY WILL EXPAND ITS ACCOUNTING POLICY TO DESCRIBE IN MORE DETAIL THE METHODOLOGY USED IN ESTIMATING THIS RESERVE. COMMENT 7: NOTE K - SEGMENT INFORMATION PAGE 60 SEC COMMENT: DISCLOSURE IN MD A PAGE 18 AND HEREIN STATE THAT YOU OPERATE IN ONE REPORTABLE SEGMENT AS THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A REPORTABLE SEGMENT. HOWEVER WE NOTE THAT THE EARNINGS OF ALL OTHER REPRESENTED IN EXCESS OF 10 (OR APPROXIMATELY 18.3 ) OF FISCAL 2004 CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS. THEREFORE IT IS UNCLEAR IF ANY OF THE THREE SEPARATE MAJOR ACTIVITIES OF ALL OTHER INDIVIDUALLY MET THE QUANTITATIVE THRESHOLD REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE SEGMENT UNDER THE GUIDANCE IN PARAGRAPH 18(B) OF SFAS NO. 131. FURTHERMORE IF EACH OF THE ACTIVITIES DO NOT MEET THE QUANTITATIVE THRESHOLD AS SPECIFIED IN PARAGRAPH 18(B) IT IS UNCLEAR HOW YOU CONSIDERED THE GUIDANCE IN PARAGRAPH 19 AS THE COMBINATION OF INFORMATION TO PRODUCE A REPORTABLE SEGMENT REQUIRE A MAJORITY OF THE AGGREGATION CRITERIA IN PARAGRAPH 17 AND SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE IN EITF 04-10. IN THIS REGARD IT APPEARS THESE SEPARATE ACTIVITIES (ACMI AND CHARTER SERVICES PART SALES AND AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICES) MAY NOT BE SIMILAR UNDER THE AREAS AND ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS SPECIFIED IN PARAGRAPH 17. PLEASE PROVIDE US YOUR CONSIDERATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE ABOVE MATTERS AND TELL US WHETHER ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES UNDER PARAGRAPHS 27-28 AND 32 MAY BE REQUIRED IN THE NOTES. COMPANY RESPONSE TO COMMENT 7: THE COMPANY S OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS INCLUDED IN THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY DO NOT INDIVIDUALLY COMPRISE 10 OF ITS REVENUES OR 10 OF ITS EARNINGS OR 10 OF ITS ASSETS AS SPECIFIED BY PARAGRAPH 18 OF SFAS NO. 131 FOR SEPARATE SEGMENT DISCLOSURE. ADDITIONALLY THESE SEGMENTS GENERALLY DO NOT SHARE A MAJORITY OF THE AGGREGATION CRITERIA LISTED IN PARAGRAPH 17 AND DO NOT HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS. ACCORDINGLY THESE ACTIVITIES ARE NOT COMBINED AND DISCLOSED AS A 5 ______________________________________________________________________ REPORTABLE SEGMENT. FURTHER BECAUSE THE DHL SEGMENT ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THEN 75 OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES SFAS NO. 131 PARAGRAPH 20 DOES NOT REQUIRE SEPARATE DISCLOSURE OF THESE QUANTITATIVELY SMALL SEGMENTS. INSTEAD PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH 21 OF SFAS NO. 131 INFORMATION ABOUT OPERATING SEGMENTS THAT ARE NOT REPORTABLE ARE COMBINED IN AN ALL OTHER CATEGORY IN THE COMPANY S SEGMENT FOOTNOTE. THE COMPANY ALSO REFERS TO THE DIAGRAM IN PARAGRAPH 127 OF SFAS NO. 131 IN CONCLUDING THAT THE OPERATING SEGMENTS THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE SEPARATELY REPORTABLE SHOULD BE COMBINED IN AN ALL OTHER CATEGORY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS APPLIED SFAS NO. 131 APPROPRIATELY AND THAT NO ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ARE REQUIRED FOR THE FORM 10-K FOR 2004. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO REGULARLY EVALUATE WHETHER ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE APPROPRIATELY DISCLOSED PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 131. COMMENT 8 SEC COMMENT: IN ADDITION WE BELIEVE THE MD A SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO COMPLETELY AND CLEARLY DISCUSS THE REASONS WHY THE NON-DHL ACTIVITIES PROVIDE A MUCH HIGHER CONTRIBUTION TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RELATIVE TO REVENUES AND WHETHER YOU WILL TRY TO EXPAND THE NON-DHL BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE OR IF THERE ARE ANY CONSTRAINTS IN EXPANDING THESE ACTIVITIES. COMPANY RESPONSE TO COMMENT 8: IN FUTURE FILINGS THE COMPANY WILL EXPAND THE MD A BASED ON THE RESPONSE BELOW TO EXPLAIN THE REASONS WHY THE NON-DHL ACTIVITIES PROVIDE HIGHER CONTRIBUTION MARGINS AND DISCLOSE THE CONSTRAINTS TO GROWING THE NON-DHL BUSINESS. THE COMPANY S MARGIN RELATIVE TO REVENUES ON DHL BUSINESS IS PREDICATED ON LARGE BUSINESS VOLUMES AND REFLECTS LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS WITH A FINANCIALLY STRONG INTERNATIONAL COMPANY. THE COMPANY S NON-DHL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OFTEN POSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OPERATING MARGINS RELATIVE TO REVENUES THAT ARE HIGHER THAN ITS MARGIN ON DHL BUSINESS. THE NON-DHL OPPORTUNITIES TYPICALLY INVOLVE SINGLE SALES OR SHORT-TERM SERVICE ARRANGEMENTS ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT CUSTOMERS. THESE OPPORTUNITIES HAVE DIFFERENT ECONOMIC AND RISK PROFILES THAT OFTEN DICTATE A HIGHER SALES PRICE AND EXPECTED RETURN THAN THE COMPANY S DHL BUSINESS. ADDITIONALLY APPROXIMATELY 21 OF THE COMPANY S REVENUES RELATED TO EXPENSES INCURRED FOR THE COMPANY S SEGMENT FOR DHL BUSINESS ON WHICH THE COMPANY DOES NOT EARN ANY MARGIN. THESE EXPENSES ARE DESCRIBED ON PAGE 15 AND QUANTIFIED ON PAGE 20 OF THE 2004 FORM 10-K. AS DESCRIBED ON PAGE 18 OF THE FORM 10-K FOR 2004 THE COMPANY IS ATTEMPTING TO EXPAND ITS NON-DHL BUSINESS IN A MARKET THAT IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE DUE TO OVER CAPACITY WITHIN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY. CONSTRAINTS TO EXPANDING ITS NON-DHL 6 ______________________________________________________________________ BUSINESS INCLUDE AVAILABILITY OF AIRCRAFT FLIGHT CREWS AND HANGAR SPACE FOR AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE PROJECTS. ADDITIONAL CONTRACTUAL CONSTRAINTS ARE DESCRIBED ON PAGE 30 OF THE 2004 FORM 10-K. OTHER THE COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADEQUACY AND ACCURACY OF THE DISCLOSURES CONTAINED IN THE ABOVE-REFERENCED FILING. THE COMPANY ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE STAFF COMMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS LETTER OR CHANGES TO DISCLOSURES IN FUTURE FILINGS IN RESPONSE TO STAFF COMMENTS DO NOT FORECLOSE THE COMMISSION FROM TAKING ANY ACTION WITH RESPECT TO THE ABOVE-REFERENCED FILING. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THAT IT MAY NOT ASSERT STAFF COMMENTS MADE IN THIS LETTER AS A DEFENSE IN ANY PROCEEDING INITIATED BY THE COMMISSION OR ANY PERSON UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE ALL CHANGES IN DISCLOSURES IN RESPONSE TO YOUR COMMENTS WILL BE INCLUDED IN FUTURE OR AMENDED FILINGS MADE PURSUANT TO THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.
