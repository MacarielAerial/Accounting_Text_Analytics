FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 3. WE NOTE YOUR DISCLOSURE THAT REVENUES FROM AIR-RELATED CHARGES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE TRANSPORTATION IS PROVIDED IF THE PRODUCT IS NOT DEEMED INDEPENDENT OF THE SCHEDULED SERVICE. THIS DISCLOSURE IMPLIES THAT YOU PROVIDE CERTAIN AIR-RELATED PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES THAT YOU DO DEEM TO BE INDEPENDENT OF YOUR SCHEDULED SERVICE. IN THIS REGARD PLEASE TELL US AND DISCLOSE THE NATURE OF ANY AIR-RELATED CHARGES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED PRIOR TO WHEN TRANSPORTATION IS PROVIDED BASED UPON THE DETERMINATION THAT THE ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE SCHEDULED SERVICE. ALSO TELL US THE BASIS FOR YOUR ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. __________________________________________________________________ COMPANY RESPONSE: THE AIR-RELATED CHARGES DEEMED TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THE ORIGINAL TICKET SALE (IDENTIFIED AS SCHEDULED SERVICE) FOR WHICH WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE AS THE CHARGE OCCURS INCLUDES OUR CHANGE FEE AND CANCELLATION FEE. A CHANGE FEE OCCURS WHEN A CUSTOMER CHANGES AN ITINERARY. A CANCELLATION FEE OCCURS WHEN A CUSTOMER CANCELS AN ITINERARY AND RECEIVES AN ISSUED CREDIT VOUCHER TO APPLY AGAINST FUTURE TRAVEL. OUR BASIS FOR THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THESE FEES DEEMED INDEPENDENT OF THE ORIGINAL TICKET SALE IS THAT THEY ARE FOUND REALIZABLE AND EARNED (RECOGNITION FACTORS IDENTIFIED IN ASC 605-10-25-1) AT THE TIME THE FEE IS ASSESSED. THE AIRLINE AUDIT GUIDE ( AAG-AIR ) IDENTIFIES THAT THE PREDOMINANT INDUSTRY PRACTICE FOR THE REVENUE RECOGNITION OF CHANGE FEES IS WHEN THE FEE IS ASSESSED. OUR DETERMINATION THAT CHANGE FEES AND CANCELLATION FEES ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE ORIGINAL TICKET SALE IS IN LINE WITH THE CRITERIA PRESENTED IN THE AAG-AIR: THE CHARGE IS SUBSEQUENT TO THE INITIAL SALES TRANSACTION THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT ON THE PASSENGER TO PAY THE FEES AT THE TIME OF THE ORIGINAL SALE AND PASSENGERS WHO PAY CHANGE FEES RECEIVE ADDITIONAL UTILITY TO WHICH THEY WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED. OUR CURRENT DISCLOSURE IDENTIFIES THAT REVENUES FROM CHANGE FEES IMPOSED ON PASSENGERS FOR MAKING CHANGES TO NONREFUNDABLE ITINERARIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS THEY OCCUR. IN RESPONSE TO THE STAFF S COMMENT IN FUTURE FILINGS WE WILL EXPAND OUR DISCLOSURE TO DESCRIBE THE REVENUE RECOGNITION PRINCIPLES FOR CANCELLATION FEES AND IDENTIFY THAT THIS AIR-RELATED SERVICE IS DEEMED INDEPENDENT OF THE ORIGINAL TICKET SALE. NOTE 5. LONG TERM DEBT SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY PAGE 49 4. PLEASE TELL US AND DISCLOSE THE NATURE OF THE ASSOCIATED MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS AS WELL AS THEIR TIMING AND AMOUNT. IF THE AMOUNTS ARE NOT QUANTIFIABLE TELL US AND DISCLOSE THE BASIS FOR DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS. COMPANY RESPONSE: IN RESPONSE TO THE STAFF S COMMENTS WE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING ENHANCED DISCUSSION OF MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS UNDER THE TERM LOAN. THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY (THE TERM LOAN ) CONTAINS MANDATORY PREPAYMENT PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CASH PROCEEDS IN EXCESS OF 5 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF CERTAIN ASSETS (WHICH ARE NOT REINVESTED WITHIN 270 DAYS) CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OR INCURRENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS FOR MONEY BORROWED IN VIOLATION OF THE COVENANTS IN THE TERM LOAN CASH PROCEEDS FROM INSURANCE OR CONDEMNATION (WHICH ARE NOT REINVESTED WITHIN 270 DAYS) AND FOR 25 OF OUR EXCESS CASH FLOW (AS DEFINED IN THE TERM LOAN) IF OUR LEVERAGE RATIO EXCEEDS 1.5:1 AS OF THE END OF ANY YEAR. IN THE EVENT WE DO NOT REINVEST THE CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF CERTAIN ASSETS OR FROM INSURANCE OR CONDEMNATION AWARDS OR IF WE INCUR INDEBTEDNESS IN VIOLATION OF THE COVENANTS IN THE TERM LOAN THE PREPAYMENT WILL BE DUE WITHIN THREE BUSINESS DAYS FOLLOWING THE DATE OF THE EVENT REQUIRING THE PREPAYMENT. THE PREPAYMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEVERAGE RATIO EXCEEDING 1.5:1 WOULD BE PAYABLE WITHIN 90 DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE YEAR FOR THE COVENANT CALCULATION. AS WE WOULD EXPECT TO REINVEST THE PROCEEDS FROM ANY ASSET SALES OR INSURANCE OR CONDEMNATION AWARDS AND WE EXPECT TO COMPLY WITH THE INCURRENCE OF DEBT COVENANTS IN THE TERM LOAN WE DO NOT EXPECT THOSE MANDATORY PREPAYMENT PROVISIONS TO BECOME APPLICABLE. AS OUR LEVERAGE RATIO CALCULATED AS OF JUNE 30 2012 IS APPROXIMATELY 0.9:1.0 WE WOULD NOT EXPECT TO HAVE TO MAKE A MANDATORY PREPAYMENT OF EXCESS CASH FLOW IF WE CAN CONTINUE TO EARN INCOME CONSISTENT WITH OUR HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE. WE EVALUATED OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THESE PROVISIONS AND RELATED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE TO CONCLUDE THE PROBABILITY OF PAYMENT AS OF DECEMBER 31 2011 IS REMOTE AND NOT SUBJECT TO FURTHER DISCLOSURE OR CHANGES IN DEBT CLASSIFICATION ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN FUTURE FILINGS WE WILL EXPAND OUR DISCLOSURE FOR THESE MANDATORY PREPAYMENT PROVISIONS. __________________________________________________________________ NOTE 6. LEASES PAGE 49 5.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2011 WE HAD 5.0 MILLION OF THESE AIRPORT FEES IN ADDITION TO THE 8.3 MILLION OF TOTAL RENTAL EXPENSE. IN FUTURE FILINGS WE WILL EXCLUDE AIRPORT FEES BASED ON VARIABLE PASSENGER AND AIRCRAFT ACTIVITY UNDER OUR USE AND LEASE AGREEMENTS FROM THE SCHEDULED FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER OPERATING LEASES WITH INITIAL OR REMAINING NON-CANCELABLE LEASE TERMS IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR .
