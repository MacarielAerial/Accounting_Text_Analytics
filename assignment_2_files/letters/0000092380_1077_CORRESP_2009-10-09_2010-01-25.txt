OCTOBER 9 2009 VIA EDGAR MR. LYN SHENK BRANCH CHIEF DIVISION OF CORPORATION FINANCE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION 100 F STREET N.E. MAIL STOP 3561 WASHINGTON D.C. 20549-3561 RE: SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO. FILE NO. 001-07259 FORM 10-K: FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2008 FORM 10-Q: FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30 2009 DEAR MR. SHENK: ON BEHALF OF SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO. (THE COMPANY ) SET FORTH BELOW ARE OUR RESPONSES TO THE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OF THE STAFF (THE STAFF ) OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IN ITS LETTER DATED SEPTEMBER 29 2009 WITH RESPECT TO THE REFERENCED DOCUMENTS. FOR EASE OF REFERENCE WE HAVE REPRODUCED BELOW THE FULL TEXT OF THE STAFF S COMMENTS EACH OF WHICH IS FOLLOWED BY THE COMPANY S RESPONSE. FORM 10-K: FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2008 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM PAGE 50 1. PER YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT NUMBER 4 YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR FREQUENT FLYER CREDITS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GUIDANCE OUTLINED IN THE AICPA AUDIT AND ACCOUNTING GUIDE FOR AIRLINES (THE AIRLINE GUIDE ). HOWEVER WE DO NOT CONCUR WITH YOUR CONCLUSION. IN THIS REGARD WE NOTE THAT PARAGRAPH 3.108 OF THE AIRLINE GUIDE STATES THAT UNDER THE INCREMENTAL COST METHOD A LIABILITY IS RECORDED FOR THE INCREMENTAL COST ASSOCIATED WITH REWARDING THOSE FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM ( FFP ) MEMBERS EXPECTED TO REDEEM MILEAGE CREDITS. IN ADDITION PARAGRAPH 3.109 OF THE AIRLINE GUIDE STATES THAT A KEY FACTOR IN ESTIMATING AN FFP OBLIGATION UNDER THE INCREMENTAL COST METHOD IS THE ESTIMATE OF MILEAGE CREDITS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE REDEEMED. WHILE WE ACKNOWLEDGE FROM YOUR RESPONSE THAT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF YOUR FFP MEMBERS FLIGHT CREDITS EXPIRE UNUSED WE BELIEVE THAT THE EXCLUSION OF ALL PARTIALLY EARNED AWARDS FROM YOUR LIABILITY IMPLIES THAT IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT ANY OF THE EXCLUDED FLIGHT CREDITS WILL ULTIMATELY BE REDEEMED BY YOUR PROGRAM S MEMBERS. FURTHERMORE PER YOUR DISCLOSURE REGARDING YOUR RAPID REWARDS FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM ON PAGE 6 IT APPEARS THAT THE LIABILITY THAT YOU RECOGNIZE IS BASED UPON THE INCREMENTAL COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EARNED AWARDS THAT YOU EXPECT TO BE REDEEMED. IN THIS REGARD WE BELIEVE THAT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE PROBABILITY OF PARTIALLY EARNED AWARDS BEING FULLY EARNED AND REDEEMED WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH YOUR PRACTICE OF TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE PROBABILITY OF FULLY EARNED AWARDS NOT BEING REDEEMED. BASED UPON THE OBSERVATIONS NOTED ABOVE WE BELIEVE THAT YOUR LIABILITY FOR FREQUENT FLYER AWARDS SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE AN ACCRUAL FOR PARTIALLY EARNED AWARDS THAT YOU EXPECT WILL BE FULLY EARNED AND REDEEMED. PLEASE REVISE YOUR ACCOUNTING POLICY ACCORDINGLY OR ADVISE. RESPONSE: WHILE THE COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE AIRLINE GUIDE COULD BE INTERPRETED IN THE MANNER SUGGESTED BY THE STAFF S COMMENT THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT ITS CURRENT ACCOUNTING FOR PARTIAL FREQUENT FLYER AWARDS IS AN ACCEPTABLE METHOD BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FACTORS. FIRST THE COMPANY NOTES THAT THIS PRACTICE WHICH HAS LONGSTANDING USE WITHIN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY IS BASED AT LEAST IN PART ON DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS AND THE STAFF IN THE EARLY 1990 S AND ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE STAFF IN OUR PREVIOUS REVIEW IN 2007. ADDITIONALLY AS DISCUSSED IN THE COMPANY S PRIOR RESPONSE OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE ISSUANCE OF THE REVISED AIRLINE GUIDE WAS NOT MEANT TO CAUSE A CHANGE IN THE EXISTING ACCOUNTING PRACTICES FOR FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAMS. FURTHER THE COMPANY NOTES THAT THE REVISED AIRLINE GUIDE IS CONSIDERED NON-AUTHORITATIVE AND IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECENTLY RELEASED FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ITS ACCOUNTING POLICY RELATED TO ITS FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM AS NEW AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE IS ISSUED. 1 __________________________________________________________________ FORM 10-Q: FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30 2009 ITEM1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 13. EARLY RETIREMENT OFFER 2. WE HAVE REVIEWED YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT NUMBER 10. HOWEVER IT IS NOT CLEAR TO US WHY YOU BELIEVE THAT THE TERMINATION BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO YOUR ONE-TIME VOLUNTARY EARLY OUT PROGRAM ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF SFAS NO. 88. PER YOUR RESPONSE YOU HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE MANDATORY SERVICE PERIOD REQUIRED FOR A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF YOUR EMPLOYEES DOES NOT QUALIFY AS A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THEREFORE YOU BELIEVE ALL COSTS OF THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE SPREAD OVER THAT SERVICE PERIOD. WHILE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PARAGRAPH 15 OF SFAS NO. 88 SUGGESTS THAT SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS WOULD ONLY BE EXPECTED TO BE OFFERED FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THE GUIDANCE DOES NOT APPEAR TO ADDRESS WHETHER OR NOT A MANDATORY SERVICE PERIOD CAN BE REQUIRED FOR THE RECIPIENTS OF SUCH BENEFITS. IN THIS REGARD WE NOTE THAT ALL OF YOUR EMPLOYEES WERE ONLY PROVIDED (I) APPROXIMATELY TWO MONTHS TO ELECT TO PARTICIPATE IN YOUR PROGRAM AND (II) ONE ADDITIONAL MONTH TO RESCIND THEIR ELECTION. BASED UPON THE FACT THAT YOUR ONE-TIME VOLUNTARY EARLY OUT PROGRAM WAS ONLY OFFERED FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IT APPEARS TO BE COVERED BY THE GUIDANCE OUTLINED IN PARAGRAPH 15 OF SFAS NO. 88. AS SUCH YOUR PROGRAM ALSO APPEARS TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF SFAS NO. 112 PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH 5(C). FURTHERMORE THE TERMINATION BENEFITS AWARDED BY YOUR PROGRAM DO NOT APPEAR TO BE ANALOGOUS TO THE BONUS COMPENSATION CONTEMPLATED BY EITF 05-5. THEREFORE WE BELIEVE YOU SHOULD REVISE YOUR INTENDED ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR THE COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO YOUR ONE-TIME VOLUNTARY EARLY OUT PROGRAM. ALTERNATIVELY EXPLAIN TO US IN FURTHER DETAIL WHY YOU DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A REVISION IS NECESSARY. RESPONSE: THE COMPANY WILL COMPLY WITH THE STAFF S REQUEST AND UTILIZE THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 88 IN RECORDING THE EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH ITS VOLUNTARY EARLY RETIREMENT PROGRAM. IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ABOVE RESPONSES TO THE STAFF S COMMENTS THE COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADEQUACY AND ACCURACY OF THE DISCLOSURE IN ITS FILINGS STAFF COMMENTS OR CHANGES TO DISCLOSURE IN RESPONSE TO STAFF COMMENTS DO NOT FORECLOSE THE COMMISSION FROM TAKING ANY ACTION WITH RESPECT TO THE FILINGS AND THE COMPANY MAY NOT ASSERT STAFF COMMENTS AS A DEFENSE IN ANY PROCEEDING INITIATED BY THE COMMISSION OR ANY PERSON UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES.
