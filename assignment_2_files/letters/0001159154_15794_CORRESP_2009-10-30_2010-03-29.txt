AUSTIN BEIJING DALLAS DENVER DUBAI HONG KONG HOUSTON LONDON LOS ANGELES MINNEAPOLIS MUNICH NEW YORK RIYADH SAN ANTONIO ST. LOUIS WASHINGTON DC __________________________________________________________________ OCTOBER 30 2009 PAGE 2 RESPONSE: IN MARCH 2007 CHAUTAUQUA AIRLINES AND SHUTTLE AMERICA AMENDED THEIR FIXED-FEE AGREEMENTS WITH DELTA AIR LINES ( DELTA ). ON MARCH 27 2007 THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK APPROVED THE AMENDED AGREEMENTS. KEY TERMS OF THE AMENDED AGREEMENTS INCLUDE THE REMOVAL OF ALL 15 THIRTY-SEVEN SEAT ERJ-135 AIRCRAFT BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER 2008 AT A RATE OF 2 AIRCRAFT PER MONTH AND EFFECTIVE MAY 1 2007 AN APPROXIMATE 3 PERMANENT REDUCTION OF BLOCK HOUR FEES CHARGED ON CHAUTAUQUA AIRLINES REMAINING 24 FIFTY SEAT ERJ-145 AND SHUTTLE AMERICA S 16 SEVENTY SEAT ERJ-170 AIRCRAFT. IN RETURN FOR THESE AMENDED TERMS DELTA AGREED TO SURRENDER ITS WARRANTS FOR 3 435 000 SHARES OF THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK AND THE COMPANY WAS GRANTED A PRE-PETITIONED UNSECURED GENERAL CLAIM IN THE AMOUNT OF 91.0 MILLION IN DELTA S CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY CASE. IN APRIL 2007 THE COMPANY SOLD THE 91.0 MILLION PRE-PETITION CLAIM TO A THIRD PARTY FOR 44.6 MILLION IN CASH. AS OF MARCH 31 2007 THE COMPANY RECORDED A RECEIVABLE FOR THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE PRE-PETITION CLAIM AND A DEFERRED CREDIT OF 44.6 MILLION WHICH REPRESENTED THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE PRE-PETITION CLAIM ON THE APPROVAL DATE BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. IN ADDITION THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET DEFERRED GAIN ON THE SURRENDER OF THE WARRANTS FROM DELTA OF 42.7 MILLION WHICH INCLUDED THE WRITE-OFF OF THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED UNAMORTIZED DEFERRED WARRANT CHARGE OF 6.4 MILLION. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY WAS REDUCED BY 32.9 MILLION NET OF TAX. THE DEFERRED CREDITS FOR THE PROCEEDS OF THE PRE-PETITION CLAIM AND THE GAIN ON THE SURRENDER OF THE WARRANTS ORIGINALLY TOTALING 87.3 MILLION ARE BEING AMORTIZED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO REVENUE ON A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS OVER THE LIFE OF THE AGREEMENTS WITH DELTA WITH AN ADJUSTMENT FOR ANY LOSSES RELATED TO THE REMOVAL AND DISPOSAL OF THE ERJ-135 AIRCRAFT CODE-SHARE AGREEMENT REJECTED IN BANKRUPTCY. THE COMPANY DEFERRED BOTH THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SURRENDERED WARRANTS AND THE PRE-PETITION CLAIM AS THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH DELTA RELATED TO THE EARLY REMOVAL OF THE ERJ-135 AIRCRAFT THE 3 REDUCTION IN FUTURE RATES SURRENDERING OF THE WARRANTS AND THE SETTLEMENT OF THE PRE-PETITION CLAIM OCCURRED CONCURRENTLY. RECOGNITION OF A GAIN UPON RECEIPT OF THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED FROM DELTA WOULD BE PREMATURE AS THE COMPANY STILL HAD AN ONGOING OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND THERE IS NO BASIS TO SEPARATE RECOGNITION OF THIS CONSIDERATION RECEIVED FROM OTHER CONSIDERATION TO BE RECEIVED FROM DELTA UNDER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE AGREEMENTS. __________________________________________________________________ OCTOBER 30 2009 PAGE 3 THE COMPANY S ACCOUNTING POLICY TO DEFER AND AMORTIZE TO REVENUE WAS BASED ON ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE APPLIED BY ANALOGY. THE DECISION TO DEFER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SURRENDERED WARRANT AND THE CASH RECEIVED FROM THE SALE OF THE DELTA PRE-PETITION CLAIM WAS BASED ON ANALOGIES TO EITF 01-9 AND ACCOUNTING FOR SERVICE TRANSACTIONS. THE DEFERRED REVENUE IS BEING RECOGNIZED OVER THE TERM OF THE DELTA CODE-SHARE AGREEMENTS BASED ON ANALOGIES TO ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE OUTLINED IN EITF 96-18. THE RECOGNITION OF ADDITIONAL WARRANT REVENUE RELATED TO THE EARLY REMOVAL OF THE ERJ-135 AIRCRAFT WAS BASED ON ANALOGIES TO ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO ACCOUNTING FOR SERVICE TRANSACTIONS. THE SELECTION OF THESE METHODS WAS DETERMINED TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CONSIDERATION PROVIDED TO DELTA IN THE FORM OF THE LOST MARGIN ON THE ERJ-135 BUSINESS AND A 3 REDUCTION IN THE RATES BILLED TO DELTA THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE TERM OF THE CODE-SHARE AGREEMENTS. THE WARRANT AMORTIZATION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2008 RELATES TO THE AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEFERRAL OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE PRE-PETITION CLAIM ( 44.6 MILLION) AND THE FAIR VALUE RELATED TO THE SURRENDER OF THE WARRANTS ( 42.7 MILLION) TOTALING 87.3 MILLION. THE DEFERRED REVENUE IS BEING AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE DELTA CODE-SHARE AGREEMENTS WITH AN ADJUSTMENT FOR FINANCIAL LOSSES RELATED TO THE REMOVAL OF ERJ-135 AIRCRAFT THAT WERE FLYING UNDER THE CODE-SHARE AGREEMENT WHICH WAS REJECTED DURING DELTA S BANKRUPTCY. AS THE COMPANY REMOVED ERJ-135 AIRCRAFT FROM SERVICE WITH DELTA AND EITHER SOLD OR RETURNED THE AIRCRAFT TO THE LESSORS THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED ADDITIONAL REVENUE EQUAL TO THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ACTIVITIES. TO DATE THE ADDITIONAL REVENUE RECOGNIZED RELATED TO THE REMOVAL OF THE ERJ-135 AIRCRAFT TOTALED 11.2 MILLION OF WHICH 7.7 MILLION AND 3.5 MILLION WAS RECOGNIZED IN 2008 AND 2009 RESPECTIVELY. ALL OF THE ERJ-135 AIRCRAFT HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM SERVICE WITH DELTA. ACCORDINGLY AS OF SEPTEMBER 30 2009 THE COMPANY HAS 57.7 MILLION OF DEFERRED REVENUE REMAINING RELATED TO THE DELTA AGREEMENTS THAT WILL BE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE AGREEMENTS (THROUGH APRIL 2016). THE AMORTIZATION OF 15.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2008 TO REVENUE CONSISTS OF 8.2 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS AND 7.7 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENT TO COVER THE FINANCIAL LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EARLY REMOVAL OF THE ERJ-135 AIRCRAFT. THE COMPANY WILL REVISE ITS NOTES TO PROPERLY DISCLOSE THE AMORTIZATION POLICY IN OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31 2009 AND IN APPLICABLE FUTURE FILINGS. __________________________________________________________________ OCTOBER 30 2009 PAGE 4 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2.

ADDITIONALLY PLEASE TELL US HOW YOU DETERMINED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE WARRANTS SURRENDERED BY DELTA. AS PART OF YOUR RESPONSE PLEASE INCLUDE ALL SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED IN YOUR FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION.
