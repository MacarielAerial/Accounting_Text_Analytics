THOMAS HORTON AMR CORPORATION PAGE 2 OF 6 FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2005 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OTHER INFORMATION CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES PAGE 39 1. WE NOTE THAT YOU USE THE INCREMENTAL COST METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR YOUR FREQUENT FLIER LIABILITY. PLEASE TELL US AND IF MATERIAL INCLUDE A DISCUSSION WHETHER YOU EXPECT YOUR ESTIMATED LIABILITY TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED IN FUTURE PERIODS DUE TO THE ESCALATING COST OF FUEL. NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (RESTRICTED CASH) PAGE 52 2. WE HAVE NOTED THAT A NUMBER OF REGISTRANTS IN YOUR INDUSTRY (AIRLINE CARRIERS) HAVE HAD CASH HELD BACK ( CASH RESERVES ) WITH CREDIT CARD PROCESSORS OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AS COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT CREDIT CARD HOLDBACKS FOR ADVANCE TICKET SALES MADE BY CUSTOMERS AS SECURITY FOR THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE OF UNUSED TICKETS THAT AFFORDS CONSUMERS WITH CERTAIN PROTECTIONS UNDER FEDERAL LAWS (GOVERNING CREDIT CARD USE) IN THE EVENT THAT AN AIRLINE FAILS TO FULFILL ITS TRAVEL OBLIGATION INCLUDING THE BANKRUPTCY OF THE AIRLINE. IN THIS REGARD WE ALSO NOTE THAT THE FUNDS ARE NOT MADE AVAILABLE TO THE AIRLINE UNTIL THE RELATED TRAVEL SERVICE IS PROVIDED. IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT REGISTRANTS MAY CLASSIFY THE AMOUNT OF CASH HOLDBACKS AS RESTRICTED CASH ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET UNTIL THE CASH IS RECEIVED BY THE AIRLINE UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF THE SCHEDULED FLIGHT DEPARTURE. FROM THE DISCLOSURES IN THE ACCOUNTING POLICY NOTES IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER YOUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAIN ANY CASH HOLDBACKS ( RESERVES ) OF THIS TYPE THAT HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS RESTRICTED CASH . PLEASE ADVISE ACCORDINGLY. 3. HOWEVER WE NOTE THAT YOUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS REFLECT ALL CHANGES IN RESTRICTED CASH AS AN INVESTING ACTIVITY. IF YOUR RESTRICTED CASH INCLUDES THIS TYPE OF CASH RESERVES DESCRIBED ABOVE IT APPEARS THAT CLASSIFICATION OF THE INCREASE IN RESTRICTED CASH AS AN INVESTING ACTIVITY AT THE DATE A TICKET IS SOLD MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE. AS SUCH OPERATING CASH FLOWS WOULD BE FAVORABLY IMPACTED ON THE INITIAL DATE OF A SALE OF AN AIRLINE TICKET BY THE INCREASE IN DEFERRED REVENUE FROM THE TICKET SALE WHILE THE INCREASE IN RESTRICTED CASH IS CLASSIFIED AS AN INVESTING ACTIVITY. AS THE AIRLINE IS NOT ENTITLED TO THE RECEIPT OF THESE CASH RESERVES UNTIL THE OCCURRENCE OF THE SCHEDULED FLIGHT DEPARTURE IT APPEARS ONE CAN VIEW THE CASH HOLDBACK AMOUNTS IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO AN UNCOLLECTED AMOUNT BILLED TO A CUSTOMER (I.E. TRADE ACCOUNT RECEIVABLE) AS OPPOSED TO A COLLECTION FROM A CUSTOMER FOLLOWED BY AN INVESTMENT IN RESTRICTED CASH . IN THE ALTERNATIVE THE UNCOLLECTED AMOUNT THAT IS RESTRICTED AS TO ITS ULTIMATE COLLECTION UNTIL THE FULFILLMENT OF THE CARRIER S TRAVEL OBLIGATION COULD ALSO BE AFFORDED TREATMENT AS A NON-CASH TRANSACTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH PARAGRAPH 32 OF SFAS 95 ON THE DATE THE TICKET IS SOLD. THE TREATMENT IN EITHER OF THESE VIEWS WOULD NOT IMPACT OPERATING CASH FLOWS ON THE DATE THE TICKET IS SOLD AS IT APPEARS THAT OPERATING CASH FLOWS MR. THOMAS HORTON AMR CORPORATION PAGE 3 OF 6 SHOULD NOT BE IMPACTED UNTIL THE TRAVEL OBLIGATION IS COMPLETED AND THE COMPANY IS ENTITLED TO THE CASH FROM THIS REVENUE PRODUCING ACTIVITY. IT ALSO APPEARS THAT FOOTNOTE 1 OF SFAS 95 WOULD NOT APPLY DIRECTLY OR BY ANALOGY TO THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AS (I) THE CASH ON HAND WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS APPLIES DIRECTLY TO THE DEFINITION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES UNRESTRICTED CASH CASH EQUIVALENTS IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND (II) THE BANK S GRANTING OF A LOAN BY CREDITING THE PROCEEDS TO A CUSTOMER S DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNT IS A CASH PAYMENT BY THE BANK AND CASH RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER WHEN ENTRY IS MADE APPEARS TO APPLY TO THE CUSTOMERS ABILITY TO ACCESS UNRESTRICTED FUNDS LOANED BY THE BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WHEN LOANED FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE. IN THE EVENT THAT YOUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE ANY AMOUNTS OF RESTRICTED CASH AS DESCRIBED ABOVE PLEASE FURNISH US HOW (THE AMOUNTS) YOUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS WOULD BE IMPACTED FOR EACH OF THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS IF THERE IS NO IMPACT ON OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN TREATING THIS ITEM SIMILAR TO A TRADE RECEIVABLE OR AS A NON-CASH TRANSACTION AT THE DATE A TICKET IS SOLD AS OPPOSED TO CLASSIFYING THE AMOUNT OF RESTRICTED CASH AS AN INVESTING ACTIVITY UPON THE SALE OF A TICKET UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ADDITION PLEASE CONSIDER THE VIEWS ABOVE AND TELL US WHY YOU BELIEVE YOUR ACCOUNTING TREATMENT IS APPROPRIATE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. IF NECESSARY PLEASE REVISE YOUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS ACCORDINGLY. NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (PROPERTY EQUIPMENT) PAGE 53 4.

THIS CHANGE IN EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CHANGE IN ESTIMATE THAT PROSPECTIVELY REDUCED YOUR DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY 108 MILLION IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2005. IN THIS REGARD THE CHANGE MATERIALLY REDUCED YOUR FISCAL 2005 OPERATING LOSS AND NET LOSS (INCLUDING THE RELATED PER SHARE AMOUNTS) BY APPROXIMATELY 55 AND 12 RESPECTIVELY. IT APPEARS THIS CHANGE WILL CONTINUE TO MATERIALLY IMPACT YOUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS. AS YOUR DISCLOSURE IS VAGUE AND SOLELY LIMITED TO DESCRIBING THE MATERIAL CHANGE AS TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT THE EXPECTED USEFUL LIVE WE ARE UNCLEAR ON THE CHANGES IN EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WARRANT THIS REVISION IN DEPRECIABLE LIVES FOR CERTAIN OF YOUR AIRCRAFT. 5.

THOMAS HORTON AMR CORPORATION PAGE 4 OF 6 MAINTENANCE EXPENDITURES REQUIRED TO OBTAIN THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE ASSETS RELATIVE TO ITS CARRYING VALUE AS THE AIRCRAFT AGES ETC. MAY SUGGEST A LIMITED USEFUL LIFE THAT DOES NOT WARRANT AN EXTENSION FROM ITS PRIOR USEFUL LIFE. IN VIEW OF ALL THE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS AS TO THE APPROPRIATENESS OF YOUR CHANGE MADE TO INCREASE THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF CERTAIN AIRCRAFT. WITH RESPECT TO THIS MATERIAL CHANGE PLEASE COMPLETELY AND CLEARLY PROVIDE US WITH THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ON THIS MATTER: THE CHANGE IN EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WARRANTED A REVISION IN DEPRECIABLE LIVES OF THESE AIRCRAFT AS OF THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2005 THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE RELIED UPON THAT OBJECTIVELY JUSTIFIES AND SUPPORTS THIS CHANGE IN ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THESE DEPRECIABLE ASSETS ALL THE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS AND FEATURES OF THESE THREE TYPES OF AIRCRAFT THAT SUPPORT A GREATER USEFUL LIFE THAN YOUR OTHER AIRCRAFT. IN ADDITION PLEASE SPECIFICALLY TELL US WHY THESE TWO TYPES OF BOEING AIRCRAFT WARRANT AN EXTENSION OF LIFE WHILE OTHER BOEING AIRCRAFT IN YOUR FLEET CURRENTLY HAVE SHORTER ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OR WERE ACCELERATED IN THEIR RETIREMENT DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS THE CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO YOUR PRIOR HISTORY OF ACCELERATING THE RETIREMENT OF AIRCRAFT IN JUSTIFYING THIS CHANGE TO INCREASE THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THESE AIRCRAFT THE EFFECTS OF COMPETITION ECONOMIC FACTORS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES LEVEL OF MAINTENANCE EXPENDITURES AS THE AIRCRAFT AGES ETC. AS CITED IN OUR 2ND PARAGRAPH OF THIS COMMENT ABOVE IN SUPPORTING THIS REVISION IN ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE THE REASONS THAT YOU BELIEVE A 30 YEAR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE IS APPROPRIATE WHILE YOUR COMPETITORS (OTHER MAJOR AIRLINE CARRIERS) GENERALLY LIMIT THE LIFE OF ALL THEIR AIRCRAFT TO A MAXIMUM OF 25 YEARS. FURTHERMORE SPECIFICALLY TELL US THE REASONS YOU BELIEVE A 30 YEAR ESTIMATED LIFE IS APPROPRIATE FOR THESE THREE AIRCRAFT WHILE OTHER COMPANIES ARE DEPRECIATING THESE SAME AIRCRAFT OVER SHORTER ESTIMATED LIVES (E.G. 25 YEARS) WHY THIS MATERIAL CHANGE DID NOT RESULT IN ROBUST MD A DISCLOSURE INCLUDING A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES DISCUSSION IN ACCORDANCE WITH FR-72 ON THIS SENSITIVE AND CRITICAL CHANGE IN ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES THERETO WHETHER YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND AUDIT COMMITTEE FULLY CONSIDERED YOUR SUPPORTING EVIDENCE FOR THIS CHANGE AND FORMALLY CONCURRED WITH MANAGEMENT S DECISION AS THE DISCLOSURE IN THE PROXY MATERIALS FILED APRIL 21 2006 DOES NOT ADDRESS THIS MATERIAL CHANGE AS BEING SPECIFICALLY DISCUSSED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE IN ITS MEETINGS AND THE AUDIT EVIDENCE THAT YOU FURNISHED TO ERNST YOUNG LLP YOUR INDEPENDENT AUDITOR TO SUPPORT THIS SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO INCREASE THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THESE AIRCRAFT MR. THOMAS HORTON AMR CORPORATION PAGE 5 OF 6 WE BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER ALL THE ABOVE MATTERS IN ASSESSING WHETHER THIS ESTIMATED CHANGE IN USEFUL LIVES OF THESE AIRCRAFT IS APPROPRIATE.
