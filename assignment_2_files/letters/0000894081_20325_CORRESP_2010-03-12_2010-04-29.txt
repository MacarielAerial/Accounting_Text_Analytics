(THE COMPANY ). OUR RESPONSE TO THE STAFF S COMMENTS IS PROVIDED BELOW. FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE WE HAVE INCLUDED THE COMMENTS FOLLOWED BY THE COMPANY S RESPONSES. CAPTION REFERENCES AND PAGE NUMBERS REFER TO THE CAPTIONS AND PAGES CONTAINED IN THE RESPECTIVE FORM 10-Q OR SCHEDULE 14A UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED. CAPITALIZED TERMS USED BUT NOT OTHERWISE DEFINED HEREIN HAVE THE MEANINGS ASCRIBED TO SUCH TERMS IN THE RESPECTIVE FORM 10-Q OR SCHEDULE 14A. ALL NUMBERS ARE IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT WHERE NOTED OTHERWISE AND EXCEPT FOR PER SHARE DATA. FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30 2009 NOTE A-SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT POSITION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES SEC COMMENT 1: 1. YOUR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS ASSUMES CAM WILL LEASE 43 AIRCRAFT IN 2009. HOWEVER NOTE G ON PAGE 16 OF YOUR FORM 10-Q INDICATES THAT CAM LEASED 3 AIRCRAFT TO EXTERNAL CUSTOMERS. IN THIS REGARD IF YOUR LEASE PROJECTIONS INCLUDE AIRCRAFT CURRENTLY LEASED UNDER THE DHL ACMI AGREEMENT TELL US HOW YOUR PROJECTIONS ADDRESS THE FUTURE UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO SUCH AGREEMENTS. IN ADDITION IF SUCH AIRCRAFT ARE PUT TO DHL TELL US HOW YOUR CAM CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS WOULD BE AFFECTED. _______________________________________________________________________ COMPANY RESPONSE TO COMMENT 1: OUR LEASE PROJECTIONS FOR CAM AS OF DECEMBER 31 2008 INCLUDED NINE OF THE BOEING 767 NON STANDARD FREIGHTER AIRCRAFT THAT OPERATED UNDER THE DHL ACMI AGREEMENT. OUR PROJECTIONS INCLUDED THE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES NECESSARY TO CONVERT THOSE AIRCRAFT FROM NON STANDARD FREIGHTER TO STANDARD FREIGHTER CONFIGURATION. AT THE TIME BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE OPERATING IN DHL S NETWORK AND OUR INTERACTIONS WITH DHL NETWORK PLANNING WE ESTIMATED THAT DHL WOULD NEED UP TO 18 STANDARD FREIGHTER AIRCRAFT. OUR FAIR VALUE PROJECTIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31 2008 INCLUDED THE MODIFICATION OF 11 BOEING 767 AIRCRAFT AND ONE 757 AIRCRAFT BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF BOEING 767 AIRCRAFT TO 18 AND THE NUMBER OF BOEING 757 AIRCRAFT TO TWO FOR CAM S FAIR VALUE PROJECTIONS. BY COMPARISON IN OUR RECENT FAIR VALUE PROJECTIONS FOR CAM AS OF DECEMBER 31 2009 WE INCLUDE THE LEASE OF 24 BOEING 767 AIRCRAFT AND TWO BOEING 757 AIRCRAFT. THIS PROJECTION IS BASED ON EXISTING LEASES TO THIRD PARTIES CONTRACTED LEASES TO THIRD PARTIES NEGOTIATIONS WITH DHL FOR 13 BOEING 767 AIRCRAFT UNDER SEVEN YEAR LEASES AND THE AIRLIFT NEEDED BY ATSG AIRLINES TO SUPPORT THEIR CUSTOMERS. WE CURRENTLY HAVE A NON-BINDING MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTATING WITH DHL REGARDING AIRCRAFT LEASES. THE PARTIES ARE EXCHANGING DRAFTS OF THE RELATED DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS WITH THE GOAL OF EXECUTING THEM BY MARCH 31 2010. THE COMPANY NEEDS 28 BOEING 767 STANDARD FREIGHTERS TO MAINTAIN ITS EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND MEET THE ABOVE REFERENCED LEASE COMMITMENTS INCLUDING 13 FOR DHL. WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO MODIFY MORE AIRCRAFT OVER THE NEXT 18 MONTHS TO MEET ANTICIPATED DEMAND BEYOND 28 BOEING 767 FREIGHTERS BUT WE HAVE NOT INCLUDED THESE IN OUR FAIR VALUE PROJECTIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31 2009. IF INCLUDED THESE ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT LEASES WOULD INCREASE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF CAM. WE HAVE NO PLANS TO PUT ANY MORE AIRCRAFT TO DHL. WE WILL DECIDE TO PLACE ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT INTO THE MODIFICATION PROCESS AFTER CONSIDERING A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE FLEET PLANS OF CUSTOMERS LONG TERM DEMAND FOR AIRLIFT THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF CUSTOMER PROSPECTS COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVES AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IF A NON-STANDARD BOEING 767 AIRCRAFT IS NOT PLACED INTO THE MODIFICATION PROCESS WE WILL CONSIDER OTHER ALTERNATIVES INCLUDING THE SALE OF THE AIRCRAFT OPERATING IT AS A NON STANDARD FREIGHTER OR FOR SALVAGE AND PART-OUT TO SUPPORT THE COMPANY S OTHER BOEING 767 AIRCRAFT. SEC COMMENT 2: 2. WE NOTE THAT YOUR ACTUAL RESULTS FOR ATI WERE LOWER THEN PROJECTED. WHILE YOU INDICATED THAT ACTUAL RESULTS WERE NOT CONSISTENT WITH HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT DOWNTURN AND ECONOMIC CONDITION PLEASE TELL US HOW YOU CONSIDER WHETHER THESE RESULTS MAY BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE TRENDS WHEN CALCULATING THE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS USED IN YOUR 2009 IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS. 2 _______________________________________________________________________ COMPANY RESPONSE TO COMMENT 2: DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2009 ATI EXPERIENCED A HIGHER LEVEL OF AIRCRAFT DOWN TIME IN REMOTE LOCATIONS AND MORE EXPENSE RELATED TO THESE FAILURES THAN PROJECTED. THIS TREND IS FACTORED INTO OUR 2010 AND FUTURE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS USED IN OUR DECEMBER 31 2009 GOODWILL EVALUATION. OUR RECENT CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS FOR ATI INCORPORATE THE AIRLIFT REQUIREMENTS PROVIDED TO ATI BY ITS MAJOR CUSTOMERS. BASED ON THESE INPUTS WE PROJECT THAT ATI S EBITDA WILL INCREASE LESS THAN 8 IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 REFLECTING CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH BOEING 767 AIRCRAFT THAT ATI HAS ADDED. SEC COMMENT 3 3. YOU INDICATE THAT ACTUAL RESULTS FROM CAM WERE LOWER THEN PROJECTED RESULTS DUE TO DELAYS IN DEPLOYMENTS. IN THIS REGARD PLEASE TELL US THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THESE DELAYS AND CLARIFY WHY YOU BELIEVE THAT CAM WILL ULTIMATELY MODIFY AND DEPLOY MORE AIRCRAFT THEN ORIGINALLY ASSUMED. COMPANY RESPONSE TO COMMENT 3: THE DELAYS IN PLACING AIRCRAFT INTO LEASE WERE TEMPORARY IN 2009. ONE OUTSIDE CUSTOMER WITH A CONTRACT TO LEASE TWO BOEING 767 FREIGHTERS WAS DELAYED WHILE THE CUSTOMER SECURED NECESSARY REGULATORY APPROVAL AND COMPLETED CREW TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. ONE OF THESE AIRCRAFT LEASES BEGAN ON MARCH 2 2010 WHILE THE OTHER LEASE IS EXPECTED TO COMMENCE IN A FEW MORE WEEKS. OUR RECENT FAIR VALUE PROJECTIONS FOR CAM INCLUDE THE LEASE OF 24 BOEING 767 AIRCRAFT COMPARED TO OUR ASSUMPTION OF 18 BOEING 767 AIRCRAFT USED IN OUR PREVIOUS VALUATION. THE RECENT PROJECTION IS BASED ON EXISTING LEASES TO THIRD PARTIES CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED LEASES TO THIRD PARTIES CURRENT NEGOTIATIONS WITH DHL FOR 13 BOEING 767 AIRCRAFT AND THE AIRLIFT FOR ATSG AIRLINES TO SUPPORT THEIR CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY NEEDS 28 BOEING 767 AIRCRAFT TO MAINTAIN ITS EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND THE ABOVE REFERENCED LEASE COMMITMENTS INCLUDING 13 FOR DHL. WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO MODIFY MORE AIRCRAFT OVER THE NEXT 18 MONTHS TO MEET ANTICIPATED DEMAND BEYOND 28 BOEING 767 FREIGHTERS BUT WE HAVE NOT INCLUDED THESE IN OUR MOST RECENT FAIR VALUE PROJECTIONS. SEC COMMENT 4 4. PLEASE PROVIDE US WITH A SUMMARY OF THE MOST RECENT GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS YOU PERFORMED FOR ALL YOUR REPORTING UNITS. IF APPLICABLE SUCH AN ANALYSIS SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO WHAT IS PROVIDED TO YOUR CODM. 3 _______________________________________________________________________ COMPANY RESPONSE TO COMMENT 4: AT DECEMBER 31 2009 WE TESTED GOODWILL FOR THE TWO REPORTING UNITS WITH GOODWILL SPECIFICALLY ATI AND CAM. WE UTILIZED AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM TO ASSIST US IN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. WE ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF ATI USING A COMBINATION OF MARKET APPROACH AND A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL (AN INCOME APPROACH). WE ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF CAM USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL. A MARKET APPROACH WAS NOT UTILIZED FOR CAM DUE TO THE LACK OF COMPARABLE PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES. THE TABLE BELOW SUMMARIZES OUR UNAUDITED ANALYSIS. DECEMBER 31 2009 ATI CAM FAIR VALUE APPROACH MARKET MULTIPLES AS A OF CARRYING VALUE 123 NA DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AS A OF CARRYING VALUE 112 116 ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AS A CARRYING VALUE 116 116 DISCOUNT RATE 11.5 11.5 YEARS TO TERMINAL VALUE 10 10 LONG TERM GROWTH RATE 2 2 TERMINAL VALUE AS A OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS 56 44 PROJECTED AIRCRAFT IN SERVICE DURING 2010 19 47 AIRCRAFT IN SERVICE AS OF SEPTEMBER 30 2009 18 41 NEXT FISCAL YEAR EBITDA AS OF LAST TWELVE MONTHS EBITDA 109 134 ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS WERE DISCOUNTED BACK TO THEIR PRESENT VALUE BASED ON THE REQUIRED RATES OF RETURN FOR EQUITY AND DEBT HOLDERS. WE WEIGHTED THE REQUIRED RATES OF RETURN OF EQUITY AND DEBT HOLDERS BASED ON THE EXPECTED CAPITAL STRUCTURE FOR OUR INDUSTRY. WE USED A WEIGHTED CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF 60 EQUITY AND 40 DEBT TO DERIVE A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL OF 11.5 . THE REQUIRED RATE OF RETURN FOR EQUITY HOLDERS IS BASED ON A RISK-FREE RATE OF RETURN ADJUSTED UPWARD FOR RISK PREMIUMS FROM MARKET RISKS INDUSTRY RISK AND SMALL STOCKS. THE COST OF DEBT IS BASED ON 20 YEAR CORPORATE BONDS ADJUSTED FOR THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS ON INTEREST. AS WE NOTED IN OUR PREVIOUS RESPONSE TO YOU DATED FEBRUARY 2 2010 WE WILL INCLUDE IN OUR FUTURE FILINGS THE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES REGARDING GOODWILL CARRYING VALUES AS REQUESTED BY THE STAFF IN YOUR LETTER TO US DATED DECEMBER 31 2009.
