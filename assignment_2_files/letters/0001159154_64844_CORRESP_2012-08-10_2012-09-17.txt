FOR CONVENIENCE OF REFERENCE THE TEXT OF THE COMMENTS IN THE STAFF S LETTER HAS BEEN REPRODUCED IN BOLD TYPE HEREIN. COMMENT ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2011 QUARTERLY INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) PAGE 50 1. WE NOTE THAT YOU HAVE SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN QUARTERS AS SHOWN IN THE QUARTERLY DATA FOR BOTH 2010 AND 2011. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE GUIDANCE IN ITEM 302(A)(3) OF REGULATION S-K REQUIRES THAT SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA INCLUDE A DISCUSSION OF ANY EXTRAORDINARY UNUSUAL OR INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING ITEMS RECOGNIZED IN EACH FULL QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEARS PRESENTED AS WELL AS THE AGGREGATE EFFECT AND THE NATURE OF YEAR-END OR OTHER ADJUSTMENTS WHICH ARE MATERIAL TO THE RESULTS OF THAT QUARTER.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES PAGE 60 FIXED-FEE SERVICES REVENUES PAGE 64 2. WE NOTE THAT REVENUE RECOGNIZED UNDER FIXED-FEE SERVICE AGREEMENTS OR CAPACITY PURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH YOUR PARTNERS IS RECOGNIZED ON A GROSS BASIS. WE ALSO NOTE THAT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS YOU HAVE REVISED OR ADDED CAPACITY PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. IN LIGHT OF THESE RECENT CHANGES PLEASE TELL US WHY YOU CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT GROSS REVENUE RECOGNITION IS APPROPRIATE INCLUDING YOUR ANALYSIS OF YOUR CAPACITY PURCHASE AGREEMENTS UNDER THE AICPA AIRLINE GUIDE SECTIONS 9.66 THROUGH 9.73. YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD ADDRESS WHETHER YOUR CAPACITY PURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH EACH CARRIER HAVE DIFFERING ELEMENTS THAT WOULD REQUIRE A DIFFERENT REVENUE PRESENTATION DEPENDING ON THE TERMS OF EACH AGREEMENT. IN THIS REGARD WE NOTE THAT FOR SOME AGREEMENTS CERTAIN EXPENSES NOT BILLED TO YOU ARE NOT RECORDED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER PASS THROUGH COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON A GROSS BASIS. YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD CLARIFY WHICH COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON A GROSS BASIS AND WHICH COSTS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED FOR EACH AGREEMENT IF THE TERMS DIFFER AND PROVIDE THE RATIONALE THAT SUPPORTS THE BASIS FOR YOUR CONCLUSIONS. RESPONSE FOR ALL OF ITS CAPACITY PURCHASE AGREEMENTS (FIXED-FEE SERVICE OR CODE-SHARE AGREEMENTS) THE COMPANY RECEIVES FIXED FEES AS WELL AS REIMBURSEMENT OF SPECIFIED PASS THROUGH COSTS ON A GROSS BASIS WITH ADDITIONAL POSSIBLE INCENTIVES FROM PARTNERS FOR SUPERIOR SERVICE. THESE REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED AND THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ESTIMATE OF THE PROFIT COMPONENT BASED UPON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE END OF THE ACCOUNTING PERIOD. THE REIMBURSEMENT OF SPECIFIED COSTS KNOWN AS PASS THROUGH COSTS MAY INCLUDE AIRCRAFT OWNERSHIP COST PASSENGER LIABILITY AND HULL INSURANCE AIRCRAFT PROPERTY TAXES LANDING FEES AND CATERING. EXCEPT FOR FUEL THAT THE COMPANY PURCHASED FOR USE UNDER THE UNITED CODE-SHARE AGREEMENT PRIOR TO JULY 2012 FUEL IS NOT CONSIDERED A PASS-THROUGH COST AND IS DISCUSSED SEPARATELY BELOW. IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO RECORD REVENUE ON A GROSS BASIS THE COMPANY EVALUATES EACH PASS THROUGH COST IN EACH CODE-SHARE AGREEMENT AGAINST THE GUIDANCE WITHIN THE AICPA AIRLINE GUIDE SECTIONS 9.66 THROUGH 9.73 AND ASC 605-45-45. IN ALL CASES THE COMPANY IS THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR AND HAS THE CREDIT RISK WITH THE THIRD PARTY VENDORS PROVIDING GOODS AND SERVICES PROCURED TO PERFORM UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS. MOREOVER THE COMPANY OFTEN HAS DISCRETION IN SELECTING WHICH PARTICULAR VENDORS IT TRANSACTS FOR THESE GOODS AND SERVICES. AS THE COMPANY S AGREEMENTS DO NOT HAVE DIFFERING ELEMENTS REQUIRING DIFFERENT REVENUE PRESENTATION REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PASS THROUGH COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON A GROSS BASIS FOR ALL OF THE CAPACITY PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES TO THE SUBSTANCE OF THESE AGREEMENTS IN RECENT YEARS THAT WOULD IMPACT THIS CONCLUSION REGARDING PASS THROUGH COSTS. AS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE COMPANY S 2011 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FILED AS PART OF ITS 2011 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ALL OF THE COMPANY S CODE-SHARE AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN THE UNITED CODE-SHARE AGREEMENT THE COMPANY DOES NOT INCUR FUEL COST OR RECORD FUEL EXPENSE OR RELATED REVENUE IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS NOT THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR OF THE FUEL PURCHASE DOES NOT HAVE THE OPERATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR FUEL SUPPLY IS NOT EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK WITH THE FUEL PROVIDER AND HAS NO DISCRETION IN THE SELECTION OF FUEL VENDORS. FURTHERMORE THE COMPANY IS UNAWARE OF THE COST OF FUEL SUPPLIED BY ITS CODE-SHARE PARTNERS OR THEIR THIRD PARTY FUEL VENDORS. PRIOR TO JULY 2012 FUEL WAS A PASS THROUGH COST UNDER THE UNITED CODE-SHARE AGREEMENT IN WHICH 2 __________________________________________________________________ THE COMPANY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PURCHASING FUEL BORE THE CREDIT RISK OF THE FUEL SUPPLIER AND MAINTAINED DISCRETION AS TO THE SELECTION OF FUEL VENDORS. UNDER THOSE TERMS FUEL EXPENSE AND THE RELATED REVENUE WERE RECOGNIZED ON A GROSS BASIS IN OUR STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. BEGINNING IN JULY 2012 UNITED HAS AGREED TO SUPPLY FUEL DIRECTLY TO OUR FLIGHTS UNDER ITS CODE-SHARE AGREEMENTS AND THE COMPANY WILL NO LONGER RECOGNIZE THE COST OF FUEL AND RELATED REVENUE FOR FUEL USED UNDER THE UNITED CODE-SHARE AGREEMENT FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE. COMMENT 4. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES PAGE 68 3. WE NOTE FROM PAGE 70 THAT THE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THE CALCULATION OF GAIN ON BARGAIN PURCHASE INCLUDE 37 MILLION OF CASH INJECTED INTO FRONTIER FROM REPUBLIC. PLEASE TELL US WHEN SUCH CASH WAS INJECTED INTO REPUBLIC AND WHY IT IS APPROPRIATE TO INCLUDE CASH GIVEN TO FRONTIER AS PART OF THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND THEREFORE INCREASING THE GAIN ON BARGAIN PURCHASE. WE MAY HAVE FURTHER COMMENT UPON RECEIPT OF YOUR RESPONSE. RESPONSE ON AUGUST 13 2009 THE SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED INVESTMENT AGREEMENT BY AND AMONG THE COMPANY AND FRONTIER AIRLINES HOLDINGS INC. FRONTIER AIRLINES INC. AND LYNX AVIATION INC. AND THEIR SUCCESSORS ( FRONTIER ) WAS EXECUTED. THAT AGREEMENT REFLECTED THE BINDING COMMITMENTS MADE BY THE COMPANY AT THE AUCTION PROCESS FOR FRONTIER. UNDER SECTION 2.01 OF THE AGREEMENT THE COMPANY AGREED TO PURCHASE FROM THE REORGANIZED COMPANY 1 000 COMMON SHARES REPRESENTING 100 OF THE EQUITY OF FRONTIER FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF 108.75 MILLION AND THE RELINQUISHMENT BY THE COMPANY OF ALL RIGHTS UNDER THE FRONTIER PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. ON OCTOBER 1 2009 THE TRANSACTION CLOSED FOR TOTAL CONSIDERATION OF 108.75 MILLION THAT INCLUDED DEBTOR-IN POSSESSION ( DIP ) FINANCING OF 43.1 MILLION PAYMENTS TO GENERAL UNSECURED CREDITORS OF 28.75 MILLION AND A 36.9 MILLION CASH INJECTION INTO FRONTIER. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 805-30-30-7 THE TOTAL PURCHASE CONSIDERATION ON THE CLOSING WAS CALCULATED AS THE SUM OF THE ASSETS TRANSFERRED BY THE COMPANY THE LIABILITIES INCURRED BY THE COMPANY TO FORMER OWNERS OF FRONTIER AND THE EQUITY INTERESTS ISSUED BY THE COMPANY (NONE) AS FOLLOWS: ( IN MILLIONS) CASH PAID TO GENERAL UNSECURED CREDITORS 28.75 DIP FINANCING 43.10 CASH INJECTION INTO FRONTIER 36.90 TOTAL PURCHASE CONSIDERATION 108.75 THE CASH INJECTED INTO FRONTIER ON OCTOBER 1 2009 (AT CLOSING) OF APPROXIMATELY 36.9 MILLION WAS IMMEDIATELY CONSOLIDATED BY THE COMPANY UNDER ASC 805-30-30-8 AND DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE BARGAIN PURCHASE GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY 203.7 MILLION AS IT IS INCLUDED IN BOTH THE PURCHASE PRICE AND THE ASSETS ACQUIRED. IF THE COMPANY HAD EXCLUDED THE 36.9 MILLION CASH INJECTION FROM THE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THE ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO EXCLUDE THE SAME AMOUNT FROM THE TOTAL PURCHASE CONSIDERATION. ACCORDINGLY THE BARGAIN PURCHASE GAIN OF 203.7 MILLION WOULD HAVE REMAINED UNCHANGED. MOREOVER THE COMPANY S DISCLOSURE OF 108.75 MILLION AS TOTAL PURCHASE CONSIDERATION REFLECTS THE BINDING COMMITMENTS MADE TO CAPITALIZE FRONTIER AS IT EXITED BANKRUPTCY. 3 __________________________________________________________________ COMMENT FORM 10-Q FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 2012 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE LOSS PAGE 4 4. WE NOTE FROM YOUR QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31 2012 THAT CHARTER REVENUE IS DISCLOSED ON THE FACE OF THE STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE LOSS.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AICPA AIRLINE GUIDE SECTION 3 THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION IS BASED ON WHEN THE CARRIER PROVIDES TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND THEREBY COMPLETES THE EARNINGS PROCESS. THE COMPANY S CONTRACTS WITH CHARTER CUSTOMERS PROVIDE THAT THE COMPANY IS COMPENSATED AT A CONTRACTUAL RATE FOR EACH SPECIFIC ROUTE OR BASED ON BLOCK HOURS FOR EACH FLIGHT. AS THESE ESTABLISHED TERMS RESULT IN REVENUE THAT IS FIXED AND DETERMINABLE WITH NO FUTURE PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS CHARTER REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE POINT CHARTER SERVICE REVENUE IS REALIZABLE AND EARNED WHICH IS WHEN THE TRANSPORTATION IS PROVIDED. THE COMPANY WILL INCLUDE A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY S REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY FOR CHARTER SERVICE IN FUTURE FILINGS. WE NOTE SUPPLEMENTALLY THAT IN RESPONSE TO THE STAFF S COMMENT THE COMPANY INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURE IN ITS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30 2012 WHICH WAS FILED ON AUGUST 9 2012: CHARTER AND OTHER REVENUE -CHARTER AND OTHER REVENUE PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF REVENUE RELATED TO OUR DEDICATED AND CO-SOLD SCHEDULED CHARTERS THE MARKETING COMPONENT OF OUR CO-BRANDED CREDIT CARDS CARGO REVENUES INTERLINE AND GROUND HANDLING FEES AND LEASE REVENUE FOR AIRCRAFT SUBLEASED UNDER OPERATING LEASES.

CHARTER REVENUE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30 2011 WAS 2.1 MILLION AND 7.5 MILLION RESPECTIVELY.
