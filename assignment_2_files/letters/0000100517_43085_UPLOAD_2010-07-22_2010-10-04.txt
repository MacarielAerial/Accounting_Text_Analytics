NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (I) INTANGIBLE ASSETS PAGE 116 16. BASED UPON THE EXPLANATION THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED FOR THE ADJUSTMENT TO THE INTANGIBLE ASSET BALANCE (I.E. ADJUSTMENT I ) IN YOUR PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IT APPEARS THAT YOU MAY INTEND TO TREAT THE PURCHASE PRICE CONSIDERATION ALLOCATED TO TAKE-OFF AND LANDING SLOTS AS AN INDEFINITE-LIVED ASSET. HOWEVER BASED UPON FOOTNOTE 3 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN YOUR FISCAL YEAR 2009 FORM 10-K IT APPEARS THAT THE VALUE ASSIGNED TO AIRPORT SLOTS AND GATES IS SOMETIMES AMORTIZED. IN THIS REGARD PLEASE TELL US (I) THE FACTORS THAT YOU CONSIDER AND/OR ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU MAKE WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER THE VALUE ASSIGNED TO AIRPORT SLOTS AND GATES SHOULD BE AMORTIZED OR TREATED AS AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET AND (II) WHETHER ANY PORTION OF THE MERGER PURCHASE PRICE ASSIGNED TO TAKE-OFF AND LANDING SLOTS WILL BE AMORTIZED BASED UPON SUCH FACTORS OR ASSUMPTIONS.

PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US WHY YOUR PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENT TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS ONLY RESULTED IN AN 8 MILLION PRO FORMA INCREASE TO AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31 2010 GIVEN THAT IT RESULTED IN A 66 MILLION PRO FORMA INCREASE TO AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2009.

IN THIS REGARD IT IS UNCLEAR TO US WHY YOU BELIEVE THAT THE ELIMINATION OF THE NET ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS BALANCE RELATED TO CONTINENTAL S PRIOR FUEL HEDGE ACTIVITY WOULD HAVE A CONTINUING IMPACT ON POST-MERGER (I.E. COMBINED COMPANY S) RESULTS. FURTHERMORE IT IS UNCLEAR WHY FUEL HEDGE LOSSES THAT WERE DEFERRED BY CONTINENTAL (I.E. NOT EXPENSED IN THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS) WOULD RESULT IN A PRO FORMA REDUCTION TO FUEL COSTS IN THE COMBINED COMPANY S PRO FORMA STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. PLEASE EXPLAIN THE REASON FOR YOUR ADJUSTMENT OR REVISE. IN ADDITION TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT YOUR PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENT IS APPROPRIATE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US WHY A SIMILAR ADJUSTMENT WAS NOT REQUIRED IN THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31 2010.

THOMAS J. SABATINO JR. ESQ. UAL CORPORATION JULY 22 2010 PAGE 5 22. PLEASE HAVE COUNSEL REVISE THE FIRST PARAGRAPH ON THE SECOND PAGE TO CLEARLY STATE THAT THE DISCUSSION IN THE MATERIAL TAX CONSEQUENCES SECTION OF THE PROSPECTUS IS COUNSEL S OPINION.

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AIRCRAFT AND DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PAGE 93 27. WE NOTE THAT IN CONNECTION WITH THE AIRCRAFT IMPAIRMENT TESTS PERFORMED AS OF FEBRUARY 28 2009 YOU DETERMINED THAT TWO OF YOUR FLEET TYPES HAD A CARRYING VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THAT THEY ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE. HOWEVER YOU ALSO DETERMINED THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH FLEET TYPE WAS NOT IMPAIRED AS EACH FLEET S FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED ITS RESPECTIVE CARRYING VALUE. BASED UPON YOUR DISCLOSURE ON PAGE 65 OF THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES SECTION OF MD A IT APPEARS THAT YOU MAY HAVE ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TWO FLEETS BASED UPON ASSET APPRAISALS PUBLISHED AIRCRAFT PRICING GUIDES AND/OR RECENT TRANSACTIONS FOR SIMILAR AIRCRAFT (I.E. A MARKET APPROACH). IN THIS REGARD PLEASE (I) IDENTIFY THE FLEET TYPES THAT WERE DETERMINED TO HAVE CARRYING VALUES IN EXCESS OF UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS AND (II) PROVIDE OR EXPLAIN THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR USE OF THE MARKET APPROACH TO EVALUATE EACH FLEET FOR IMPAIRMENT: THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH FLEET AS OF FEBRUARY 28 2009 THE SPECIFIC MARKET VALUATION APPROACH(ES) USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH FLEET (E.G.

YOU OR AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY) THE RELATIVE WEIGHT OF CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO EACH MARKET VALUE APPROACH IF MULTIPLE APPROACHES WERE APPLIED AND ANY KNOWN REASON(S) WHY YOUR ESTIMATES OF EACH FLEET S FAIR VALUE UNDER THE MARKET APPROACH WOULD BE EXPECTED TO EXCEED THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED FROM THE USE OF EACH FLEET. AS PART OF YOUR RESPONSE ALSO TELL US (A) THE AMOUNT BY WHICH EACH FLEET S CARRY VALUE EXCEEDED ITS PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AT FEBRUARY 28 2009 AND (B) WHETHER THE THOMAS J. SABATINO JR.

WE NOTE THAT YOU HAVE ASSIGNED THE MILEAGE PLUS DATABASE A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE USEFUL LIFE OF APPROXIMATELY SEVEN YEARS. HOWEVER THE CHANGE IN THE RELATED ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION BALANCE BETWEEN DECEMBER 31 2008 AND DECEMBER 31 2009 DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE REFLECTIVE OF THE AMORTIZATION EXPENSE THAT WOULD BE EXPECTED BASED UPON A SEVEN YEAR USEFUL LIFE. IN THIS REGARD PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY THE CHANGE IN THE ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION BALANCE BETWEEN FISCAL YEARS 2008 AND 2009 WAS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THAT WHICH WOULD BE EXPECTED. NOTE 8.

PER YOUR DISCLOSURE ON PAGE 10 YOU ADOPTED A NEW METHODOLOGY FOR RECOGNIZING MILEAGE PLUS BREAKAGE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2010. THIS CHANGE IN METHODOLOGY APPEARS TO REFLECT A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY AS EVIDENCED BY THE PREFERABILITY LETTER PROVIDED BY YOUR INDEPENDENT AUDITOR. IN THIS REGARD PLEASE TELL US WHY THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY WAS NOT APPLIED (I) RETROSPECTIVELY OR (II) BY REFLECTING THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE EARLIEST PERIOD TO WHICH THE NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE CAN BE APPLIED.
