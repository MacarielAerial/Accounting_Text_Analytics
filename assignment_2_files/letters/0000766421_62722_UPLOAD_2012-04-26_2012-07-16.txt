PLEASE RESPOND TO THIS LETTER WITHIN TEN BUSINESS DAYS BY AMENDING YOUR FILING BY PROVIDING THE REQUESTED INFORMATION OR BY ADVISING US WHEN YOU WILL PROVIDE THE REQUESTED RESPONSE. IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE OUR COMMENTS APPLY TO YOUR FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OR DO NOT BELIEVE AN AMENDMENT IS APPROPRIATE PLEASE TELL US WHY IN YOUR RESPONSE. AFTER REVIEWING ANY AMENDMENT TO YOUR FILING AND THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE IN RESPONSE TO THESE COMMENTS WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ADJUSTED NON-GAAP RESULTS AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS PAGE 27 1. IN FUTURE FILINGS PLEASE REVISE THE TITLE OF THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR TABLE ON PAGE 28 NET INCOME AND DILUTED EPS EXCLUDING NOTED ITEMS. THIS TITLE IS TOO SIMILAR TO THE GAAP TERMINOLOGY. REFER TO THE GUIDANCE IN ITEM 10(E)(1)(II)(E) OF REGULATION S-K. IN THE ALTERNATIVE ELIMINATE THE PRESENTATION OF SUCH CALCULATION AND DISCUSS ONLY THE IMPACT THE NOTED ITEMS HAD ON NET INCOME AND DILUTED EPS. BRANDON PEDERSEN ALASKA AIR GROUP INC. APRIL 26 2012 PAGE 2 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES PAGE 39 2. WE NOTE FROM YOUR DISCLOSURE ON PAGE 40 THAT 31 OF YOUR AIRCRAFT ARE UNENCUMBERED AND FROM YOUR DISCLOSURE IN NOTE 6 THAT ALL OF YOUR BORROWINGS ARE SECURED BY AIRCRAFT. PLEASE REVISE YOUR DISCUSSION OF OUTSTANDING DEBT HERE AND IN NOTE 6 TO DISCUSS THE SPECIFIC COVENANTS TO WHICH YOU ARE OBLIGATED. TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE COVENANTS CONTAIN AIRCRAFT LOAN TO FAIR MARKET VALUE REQUIREMENTS PLEASE SO STATE AND QUANTIFY TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE THE PERCENTAGE BY WHICH FAIR MARKET VALUE EXCEEDS THE AIRCRAFT LOAN AMOUNTS AS OF THE MOST RECENT BALANCE SHEET DATE. INCLUDE A DRAFT OF YOUR INTENDED DISCLOSURE WITH YOUR RESPONSE. CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS PAGE 50 3. REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE SECOND PARAGRAPH IN YOUR REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING POLICY IN NOTE 1 ON PAGE 56. WE NOTE THAT PASSENGER REVENUES INCLUDES RESERVATION FEES TICKET CHANGE FEES AND BAGGAGE SERVICE FEES. IT IS UNCLEAR TO US (I) WHY YOU CLASSIFY THESE TYPES OF ANCILLARY FEE REVENUES AS PART OF PASSENGER REVENUES AND (II) THE DISTINCTION YOU MADE IN PRESENTING A DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATION FOR OTHER ANCILLARY REVENUES (E.G. ON-BOARD FOOD AND BEVERAGE SALES COMMISSION INCOME ON SALE OF MILES ETC.) AS OTHER-NET REVENUES IN YOUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. IT APPEARS THE FEES NOTED ABOVE ARE DISTINCT CHARGES FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES SEPARATE FROM THE AIR TRANSPORTATION TRANSACTION. ALSO OTHER AIRLINES IN THE INDUSTRY MAY CLASSIFY THESE ANCILLARY SERVICE REVENUES OUTSIDE OF PASSENGER REVENUES IN A SEPARATE OTHER OPERATING REVENUE CATEGORY. PLEASE RE-EVALUATE YOUR CLASSIFICATION OF THESE ANCILLARY REVENUES AND CONSIDER WHETHER SEPARATELY CLASSIFYING THEM WITHIN AN OTHER OPERATING REVENUE CATEGORY MAY BE MORE APPROPRIATE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CLASSIFICATION OF REVENUES IS VERY IMPORTANT AND MEANINGFUL AS IT IMPACTS YOUR OPERATING STATISTICS THAT ENABLES AN INVESTOR TO ANALYZE AND COMPARE OPERATING PERFORMANCE MEASURES AMONG DIFFERENT AIRLINE COMPANIES. IN THIS REGARD THE YIELD AND PASSENGER REVENUES PER ASM OPERATING STATISTICS DATA AS PRESENTED IN SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA (ITEM 6) AND MD A OPERATING STATISTICS SUMMARY (ITEM 7) IS SPECIFICALLY IMPACTED BY THE CLASSIFICATION OF REVENUES. PLEASE ADVISE AND REVISE AS APPROPRIATE. NOTE 1 GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES REVENUE RECOGNITION PAGE 56 4. WE NOTE FROM YOUR PRESENTATION ON THE FACE OF YOUR BALANCE SHEET THAT YOUR AIR TRAFFIC LIABILITY WAS 489.4 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31 2011. PER YOUR DISCLOSURE HERE THIS ACCOUNT REPRESENTS TICKETS SOLD BUT NOT YET USED UNTIL TRAVEL OR DATE OF EXPIRATION. PLEASE EXPAND YOUR DISCLOSURE EITHER HERE OR IN YOUR DISCUSSION OF CURRENT LIABILITIES IN NOTE 12 ON PAGE 73 TO INDICATE THE PROPORTION OF THIS ACCOUNT ATTRIBUTABLE TO TICKETS SOLD BUT NOT YET USED WHICH ARE PRIOR TO THE ORIGINAL DATE OF TRAVEL AND AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO TRAVEL CREDITS. FURTHER PLEASE PROVIDE YOUR POLICY AS TO THE EXPIRATION OF TRAVEL CREDITS. BRANDON PEDERSEN ALASKA AIR GROUP INC. APRIL 26 2012 PAGE 3 NOTE 7 INCOME TAXES PAGE 63 5. WE NOTE THAT A SUBSTANTIVE AMOUNT OF YOUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN EACH OF THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS REPRESENT DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE. AS A RESULT DURING THIS THREE YEAR PERIOD YOU DID NOT MATERIALLY INCUR EITHER CURRENT INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR CASH AMOUNTS PAID FOR INCOME TAXES (AS REFLECTED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS). WE ASSUME THIS MAY HAVE OCCURRED PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION METHODS USED FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES THAT HAS GENERATED AN APPROXIMATE 800 MILLION DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY FOR THE EXCESS OF TAX OVER BOOK DEPRECIATION AS REFLECTED IN THE TABLE OF DEFERRED TAX (ASSETS) AND LIABILITIES. IN VIEW OF THIS HIGHLY MATERIAL DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY PLEASE EXPAND THE NOTES TO SPECIFICALLY DISCUSS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR TAX AND BOOK REPORTING FOR DEPRECIATION AND THE PERIODS YOU EXPECT THIS DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY TO REVERSE AND REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN YOUR CURRENT INCOME TAX EXPENSE AS WELL AS A CASH OUTLAY OF CURRENT TAXES PAYABLE. 6. IN ADDITION IN YOUR MD A ANALYSIS OF CASH FLOWS AND LIQUIDITY PLEASE INFORM READERS AS TO THE REASONABLE LIKELINESS OF AN EXPOSURE TO A MATERIAL FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS KNOWN EVENT.
