RECONCILIATION OF RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (NON-GAAP) PAGE 40 2. WE NOTE THE CALCULATION OF CAPITALIZED AIRCRAFT RENT IN FOOTNOTE (A) ON PAGE 40. PLEASE TELL US AND FURTHER EXPLAIN IN MD A THE NATURE OF THIS CALCULATION. AS PART OF YOUR RESPONSE AND YOUR REVISED __________________________________________________________________ DISCLOSURE PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW THE MULTIPLE OF 7 TIMES AIRCRAFT RENT WAS DETERMINED AND EXPLAIN WHY YOU BELIEVE THIS MEASURE IS MEANINGFUL. WE MAY HAVE FURTHER COMMENT UPON RECEIPT OF YOUR RESPONSE. RESPONSE: IN CALCULATING THE INVESTED CAPITAL COMPONENT OF ROIC WE ADJUST FOR OUR OPERATING LEASES BY USING A MULTIPLE OF AIRCRAFT RENT EXPENSE. MAKING ADJUSTMENTS FOR OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING LEASES WHICH ARE NOT REFLECTED IN GAAP BALANCE SHEETS IS A COMMON PRACTICE THROUGHOUT THE INVESTING COMMUNITY AS A MEANS OF COMPARING COMPANIES WITH DIFFERENT FINANCING STRUCTURES. THE MULTIPLE OF 7 TIMES AIRCRAFT RENT WAS USED AS IT IS A STANDARD MULTIPLE WHICH IS ROUTINELY USED BY OTHER AIRLINES (AS EVIDENCED IN PUBLIC FILINGS OR PRESS RELEASES) AND BY EQUITY ANALYSTS WITHIN THE AIRLINE SECTOR. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE REPORT ON ROIC IN FUTURE FILINGS WE WILL REVISE OUR NON-GAAP DISCLOSURE TO BE MORE DESCRIPTIVE ABOUT HOW THE LEASE ADJUSTMENT AND INPUTS THERETO ARE DETERMINED. BELOW IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE FORM THAT THE REVISED DISCLOSURE WOULD TAKE: IN DETERMINING THE INVESTED CAPITAL COMPONENT OF ROIC WE INCLUDE A NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENT FOR AIRCRAFT OPERATING LEASES AS OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT REFLECTED ON OUR BALANCE SHEETS BUT DO REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT FINANCING OBLIGATION. IN MAKING THE ADJUSTMENT WE USED A MULTIPLE OF 7 TIMES OUR AIRCRAFT RENT AS THIS IS THE MULTIPLE WHICH IS ROUTINELY USED WITHIN THE AIRLINE COMMUNITY TO REPRESENT THE FINANCING COMPONENT OF AIRCRAFT OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS. 3. WE NOTE THE DISCLOSURE IN NOTE 8 INDICATING THAT YOU HAD EQUIPMENT INSTALLED FOR OTHER AIRLINES ON YOUR BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31 2012 AND 2011 TOTALING 109 MILLION AND 111 MILLION RESPECTIVELY. PLEASE TELL US AND REVISE TO DISCLOSE THE NATURE AND TERMS OF LIVETV S SALES OF HARDWARE AND SERVICES SUCH THAT EQUIPMENT INSTALLED ON OTHER COMPANY S AIRPLANES CONTINUES TO BE REFLECTED ON YOUR BALANCE SHEET. YOUR RESPONSE AND REVISED DISCLOSURE SHOULD CLEARLY EXPLAIN HOW LIVETV RECOGNIZES REVENUE UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS OR ACCOUNTS FOR OPERATING LEASES OF EQUIPMENT AS APPLICABLE. RESPONSE: OUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY LIVETV PROVIDES INFLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT SOLUTIONS FOR VARIOUS AIRLINE CUSTOMERS. THESE SOLUTIONS INCLUDE EQUIPMENT AND RELATED INSTALLATION AS WELL AS THE LONG TERM SERVICING OF THE EQUIPMENT THEY INSTALL. LIVETV DOES NOT SELL EITHER ELEMENT INDEPENDENTLY AND IS THE EXCLUSIVE PROVIDER OF EACH ELEMENT FOR EACH OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE MULTIPLE ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE A LEASE. IN CONSIDERING THE LEASE CRITERIA WE DETERMINED THAT THE ARRANGEMENTS DID NOT MEET THE ADDITIONAL LESSOR CRITERIA IN ASC 840-10-25-42(B) DUE TO THE LONG TERM NATURE OF THE AGREEMENTS WHICH EXTENDED THROUGH 2021 AS OF DECEMBER 31 2012. THIS DETERMINATION WAS MADE AS A RESULT OF IMPORTANT UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE TOTAL COSTS TO PROVIDE ONGOING EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE AND UPKEEP THROUGHOUT THE CONTRACTUAL TERM. THEREFORE THE EQUIPMENT IS SUBJECT TO AN OPERATING LEASE WITH REVENUE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS OVER THE CONTRACTUAL TERM. THE ACCOUNTING POLICY APPLICABLE TO LIVETV S THIRD PARTY REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS IS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 ON PAGE 55 OF JETBLUE S 2012 FORM 10-K UNDER THE CAPTION LIVETV REVENUES AND EXPENSES. THIS DISCLOSURE FOCUSED ON THE MULTIPLE REVENUE ELEMENTS INHERENT IN LIVETV S ARRANGEMENTS BUT DID NOT DISCUSS OUR ACCOUNTING FOR THE EQUIPMENT SALES AS OPERATING LEASES. WE WILL REVISE THIS ACCOUNTING __________________________________________________________________ POLICY DISCLOSURE IN FUTURE FILINGS IN THE FORM SHOWN BELOW TO MORE ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THE NATURE AND TERMS OF LIVETV S COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS: LIVETV COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS: LIVETV PROVIDES INFLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT SOLUTIONS FOR VARIOUS COMMERCIAL AIRLINES.

WE ACCOUNT FOR THE EQUIPMENT AGREEMENTS AS OPERATING LEASES WITH RELATED REVENUE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE TERM OF THE RELATED CUSTOMER AGREEMENT. THIS DETERMINATION IS PRINCIPALLY AS A RESULT OF THE LONG TERM NATURE OF THESE AGREEMENTS AND THE RESULTING UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE TOTAL COSTS TO PROVIDE ONGOING EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE AND UPKEEP THROUGHOUT THE CONTRACTUAL TERM. WE ACCOUNT FOR PAYMENTS FOR ONGOING SERVICE AND SUPPORT RATABLY OVER THE TERM OF THE RELATED CUSTOMER CONTRACT. 4. WE NOTE THE DISCLOSURE IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH ON PAGE 67 WHICH INDICATES THAT IN CONNECTION WITH THE TERMINATION OF A CONTRACT WITH ONE ITS AIRLINE CUSTOMERS THE CUSTOMER PAID THE COMPANY 16 MILLION DURING 2011 WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31 2011.
