PLEASE REFER TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT 4. ALTHOUGH WE NOTE YOUR RESPONSE WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT SINCE THE TIME OF MESABA S BANKRUPTCY THE AMOUNTS YOU EXPECT TO RECOVER FROM MESABA NO LONGER REPRESENT SUBLEASE INCOME BUT A POSSIBLE GAIN CONTINGENCY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY OR MAY NOT RECEIVE AS AN UNSECURED CREDITOR IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. IT APPEARS AS THOUGH THE AMOUNT OF UNRECORDED LIABILITY ON THE BALANCE SHEET OF 7.5 MILLION IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. HOWEVER THAT AMOUNT RECORDED AS INCOME OR NETTED AGAINST THE BANKRUPTCY LOSSES IS SOMEWHAT SIGNIFICANT WITH REGARDS TO NET INCOME. PLEASE REVISE YOUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO REFLECT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY WITHOUT REGARD TO THE AMOUNTS THAT MAY POSSIBLY BE RECOVERED IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. ALTERNATIVELY EXPLAIN WHY YOU BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE YOU COULD OBTAIN SUBLEASE RENTALS OF 7.5 MILLION RELATED TO THE LEASED PROPERTY. 2. IN A RELATED MATTER PLEASE RECONCILE THE AMOUNTS FROM YOUR RESPONSE OF AN 8.1 MILLION LOSS AT DECEMBER 31 2005 WITH 10.1 MILLION DISCLOSED ON PAGE 8 OF YOUR JUNE 30 2006 10-Q. SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE AMOUNTS NETTED AGAINST THE LOSS FOR THE EXPECTED RECOVERY AT DECEMBER 31 2005. RESPONSE: IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS ABOVE WE WOULD LIKE TO OFFER THE FOLLOWING: 1) THE RECOVERIES WE EXPECT FROM MESABA ARE 2.0 MILLION. THE 7.5 MILLION REFERRED TO IN YOUR COMMENT INCLUDES THE 2.0 MILLION WE EXPECT TO RECOVER FROM MESABA PLUS 5.5 MILLION WE EXPECTED TO RECOVER FROM THIRD PARTIES TO WHOM WE COULD SUBLEASE THE SAABS. 2) WE BELIEVE THAT CONSIDERING RECOVERIES FROM MESABA IN VALUING OUR EXIT LOSS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SPIRIT AND INTENT OF FAS 146. 3) WE BELIEVE THAT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE EXISTS TO CONCLUDE THAT RECOVERIES FROM MESABA ARE HIGHLY LIKELY. AS OF DECEMBER 31 2005 THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CONTRACT LIABILITY BASED ON THE REMAINING LEASE RENTALS FOR THE LEASED SAABS WAS 15.6 MILLION INCLUDING CERTAIN COSTS TO RESTORE THE AIRCRAFT TO A CONDITION SUITABLE FOR SUBLEASE. THIS AMOUNT WAS REDUCED BY 7.5 MILLION OF EXPECTED SUBLEASE RENTAL INCOME TO ARRIVE AT A NET LOSS OF 8.1 MILLION. THE 7.5 MILLION OF EXPECTED SUBLEASE RENTAL INCOME WAS COMPRISED OF TWO SOURCES: 5.5 MILLION WE EXPECTED TO RECOVER FROM THIRD PARTIES TO WHOM WE COULD SUBLEASE THE SAABS AND 2.0 MILLION WHICH WE EXPECTED TO RECOVER VIA OUR CLAIMS AGAINST MESABA. _________________________________________________________________ SEPTEMBER 15 2006 PAGE 3 THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THESE AMOUNTS AND RECONCILES THE 10.1 MILLION LOSS AND 2.0 MILLION EXPECTED RECOVERY DISCLOSED ON PAGE 61 OF OUR DECEMBER 31 2005 FORM 10-K TO THE 8.1 MILLION NET LOSS DISCUSSED IN OUR LETTER DATED AUGUST 11 2006 (IN MILLIONS): NET PRESENT VALUE OF OUR GROSS CONTRACT LIABILITY AT DECEMBER 31 2005 15.6 FUTURE SUBLEASE RENTAL INCOME EXPECTED FROM THIRD PARTIES (5.5 ) SUBTOTAL 10.1 FUTURE RECOVERIES EXPECTED FROM MESABA (2.0 ) FAIR VALUE OF CONTRACT LIABILITY AT DECEMBER 31 2005 8.1 THE 5.5 MILLION ESTIMATE OF EXPECTED SUBLEASE INCOME FROM THIRD PARTIES WAS BASED ON MARKET INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM INDEPENDENT APPRAISERS. AS SUBLEASE INCOME FROM A THIRD PARTY IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER OUR LOST SUBLEASE INCOME FROM MESABA A BANKRUPTCY CLAIM EXISTS AGAINST MESABA FOR ITS FAILURE TO REMIT SUBLEASE RENTALS TO PINNACLE THROUGH THE TERM OF THE SUBLEASES. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT FAS 146 PRECLUDES INCLUDING AMOUNTS THAT WILL BE RECEIVED FROM THE ORIGINAL SUBLESSEE OR OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES IN ARRIVING AT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LIABILITY. WE FURTHER BELIEVE THAT INCLUDING RECOVERIES WHICH ARE REASONABLY ASSURED IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SPIRIT AND INTENT OF FAS 146 AS FAS 146 INTENDED THAT LOSSES ON EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES NOT BE RECORDED UNTIL THEY ARE INCURRED AND THAT EXIT LIABILITIES BE RECORDED AT THEIR NET FAIR VALUE. IN ESTABLISHING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR CLAIMS AGAINST MESABA WE CONSIDERED THIRD PARTY OFFERS WE HAD TO PURCHASE OUR BANKRUPTCY CLAIM AGAINST MESABA FOR APPROXIMATELY 20 OF THE STATED CLAIM. AS OUR CONTRACT LOSS BEFORE CONSIDERING THESE RECOVERIES WAS 10.0 MILLION WE ESTIMATED THE RECOVERY TO BE 20 OR 2.0 MILLION. SINCE THIS TIME WE HAVE CONTINUED TO RECEIVE OFFERS FROM AND HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES TO PURCHASE OUR BANKRUPTCY CLAIM AGAINST MESABA AT PRICES RANGING FROM 38 TO 42 OF THE STATED CLAIM. A CLAIM ALSO EXISTS AGAINST NORTHWEST AS OUR OPERATING AGREEMENT WITH NORTHWEST REQUIRES IT TO REIMBURSE PINNACLE FOR ALL AIRCRAFT RENTAL EXPENSES. IN ADDITION TO THE LIKELY RECOVERIES FROM MESABA NORTHWEST IS AN ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF RECOVERIES ALTHOUGH WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ANY CLAIM AGAINST NORTHWEST MAY BE SUBJECT TO MORE COMPREHENSIVE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN NORTHWEST AND US. HOWEVER BASED PRIMARILY ON THE MARKET OFFERS TO PURCHASE OUR CLAIM AGAINST MESABA AND TO A MUCH LESSER EXTENT ON THE CLAIM WE ALSO HAVE AGAINST NORTHWEST FOR THESE SUBLEASE LOSSES WE BELIEVE IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT THE 20 RECOVERY ESTIMATE IS REALIZABLE EITHER THROUGH BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS OR BY THE SALE OF OUR CLAIM TO A THIRD PARTY. _________________________________________________________________ SEPTEMBER 15 2006 PAGE 4 QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31 2006 NOTE 2. NORTHWEST AND MESABA BANKRUPTCY FILINGS PAGE 5 3. WE NOTE YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT 8 AND REQUIRE FURTHER INFORMATION. PLEASE PROVIDE US WITH THE JOURNAL ENTRIES POSTED INCLUDING THE ORIGINAL ENTRIES TO RECORD THE 1 778 PAYABLE TO NORTHWEST AND SUBSEQUENT RELATED ENTRIES. PLEASE CLARIFY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 1 778 THAT YOU THOUGHT APPROPRIATE TO OFFSET AGAINST NORTHWEST RECEIVABLES WITH THE 1 565 REDUCTION IN THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ALLOWANCE. TELL US WHAT OTHER EVIDENCE OTHER THAN MINIMAL DIRECT BILLINGS BY THESE VENDORS LED YOU TO BELIEVE YOU WOULD NOT OWE CERTAIN AMOUNTS TO NORTHWEST. EXPLAIN TO US IF YOU RECEIVED FURTHER INFORMATION THAT NORTHWEST HAD INDEED PAID THESE VENDORS PRIOR TO FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY OR IF THERE WAS SOME UPDATE DURING THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS THAT INDICATED THESE VENDORS WOULD NOT SEEK PAYMENT DIRECTLY FROM PINNACLE. RESPONSE (IN THOUSANDS): AT THE TIME OF NORTHWEST S BANKRUPTCY FILING WE WERE OWED 78 633 FOR SERVICES PROVIDED TO NORTHWEST UNDER OUR AIRLINES SERVICES AGREEMENT ( ASA ) AND WE OFFSET THIS AMOUNT BY 24 689 FOR AMOUNTS WE OWED DIRECTLY TO NORTHWEST FOR THE SERVICES AND SUPPLIES THEY PROVIDE TO US UNDER THE ASA. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ASA WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO THESE AMOUNTS WHICH HAS NOT BEEN DISPUTED BY NORTHWEST. THE NET OF THESE AMOUNTS OF 53 944 WAS SHOWN AS OUR PRE-BANKRUPTCY RECEIVABLE FROM NORTHWEST AT DECEMBER 31 2005. ALSO AT THE TIME OF NORTHWEST S BANKRUPTCY FILING AN ADDITIONAL 1 950 WAS OWED TO NORTHWEST FOR LANDING FEES INCURRED BY US AT CERTAIN AIRPORTS. NORTHWEST PAYS THESE FEES ON OUR BEHALF AND THEN BILLS US TYPICALLY THREE TO SIX MONTHS IN ARREARS. AT THE TIME OF THE BANKRUPTCY WE CONCLUDED IT LIKELY THAT THESE AIRPORTS WOULD TRY TO BILL US DIRECTLY FOR ANY LANDING FEES NOT PAID BY NORTHWEST DUE TO ITS BANKRUPTCY. WE THEREFORE CONCLUDED THAT WE SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THIS PRE-BANKRUPTCY LIABILITY AS AN OFFSET TO THE PRE-BANKRUPTCY AMOUNTS OWED TO US BY NORTHWEST. THROUGH MARCH 31 2006 WE HAD BEEN DIRECTLY BILLED BY CERTAIN AIRPORTS FOR 172 OF THE 1 950 OF LANDING FEES INCURRED PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 14 2005 DUE TO NON-PAYMENT BY NORTHWEST. AIRPORT AUTHORITIES TYPICALLY BILL LANDING FEES AND REQUIRE COLLECTION ON A TIMELY BASIS. FAILURE TO PAY GENERALLY RESULTS IN THE INABILITY TO LAND AT SAID AIRPORT. AS OVER SIX MONTHS HAD PASSED WE CONCLUDED IT UNLIKELY THAT ADDITIONAL BILLINGS WOULD BE RECEIVED FROM THE AIRPORTS THAT TYPICALLY BILL NORTHWEST DIRECTLY BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCES WITH RESPECT TO THE BILLING PRACTICES OF THE AIRPORTS. THEREFORE AT MARCH 31 2006 WE MADE A JOURNAL ENTRY TO REDUCE OR DEBIT OUR TRADE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE FOR 1 778 AND INCREASE OR CREDIT BY 1 778 THE AMOUNT OWED TO NORTHWEST AT THE TIME OF ITS BANKRUPTCY. THIS AMOUNT THEREFORE BECAME SUBJECT TO OFFSETTING UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ASA AND REDUCED OUR PRE-BANKRUPTCY RECEIVABLE BALANCE FROM NORTHWEST BY 1 778. FOLLOWING THE ABOVE ADJUSTMENT OF 1 778 IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO LOWER BY 1 565 OUR ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE PRE-BANKRUPTCY RECEIVABLES WHICH IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: REDUCTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE RESERVE (95 OF 1 778) 1 689 MINOR ADJUSTMENTS DUE TO OTHER CHANGES IN PREVIOUS ESTIMATES (124) NET REDUCTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE RESERVE 1 565 _________________________________________________________________ SEPTEMBER 15 2006 PAGE 5 THE JOURNAL ENTRIES RECORDED FOR THE ABOVE CHANGE IN OUR ALLOWANCE WAS TO DECREASE OR DEBIT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE RESERVE BY 1 565 AND TO DECREASE OR CREDIT OUR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE NORTHWEST BANKRUPTCY BY 1 565. QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30 2006 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PAGE 6 NOTE 6. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS PAGE 10 4. PLEASE PROVIDE US WITH FURTHER DETAILS OF THE IMPACT OF THE APBO RECOGNIZED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006 ON CURRENT AND PRIOR YEARS AND THE QUARTERLY PERIODS FOR THE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEARS. INCLUDED IN YOUR RESPONSE AT WHAT POINT IN TIME IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE LIABILITY NEEDED TO BE RECORDED. IF YOU JUST DISCOVERED THIS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006 PLEASE TELL US WHY YOU DID NOT RECORD THE ADJUSTMENT AS THE CORRECTION ON AN ERROR. IF YOU WERE AWARE OF THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE LIABILITY THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE EACH QUARTER AND DID NOT RECORD PLEASE TELL US WHY. RESPONSE: THE DISCOVERY OF THIS POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED WITH THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO WITH OUR PILOTS IN 1999 OCCURRED LATE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006. THOUGH THIS BENEFIT TO OUR PILOTS HAS BEEN IN EFFECT FOR SEVERAL YEARS OUR PILOT WORKFORCE IS GENERALLY VERY YOUNG AND MOST PILOTS HAVE MANY YEARS UNTIL THEY REACH RETIREMENT AGE. CONSEQUENTLY SINCE THE INCEPTION OF OUR PILOT CONTRACT ONLY FIVE PILOTS HAVE RETIRED ONLY ONE OF WHOM ELECTED THE MEDICAL COVERAGE PROVIDED THIS PLAN. PRIOR THE FILING OF OUR FIRST QUARTER 2006 FORM 10-Q WE WERE ABLE TO ESTIMATE A RANGE FOR OUR LIABILITY FOR THIS POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION HOWEVER WE DID NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT TIME TO COMPLETE THE NECESSARY ACTUARIAL EVALUATION TO DETERMINE THE EXACT AMOUNT TO RECORD. AS OUR ESTIMATED RANGE INDICATED THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE ERROR WAS NOT MATERIAL WE DETERMINED THAT WE WOULD COMPLETE AN ACTUARIAL EVALUATION AND RECORD THE CORRECTION OF AN ERROR IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND DISCLOSED THE IMPACT OF THE ADJUSTMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH PARAGRAPH 29 OF APB 28. IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING FOR THIS ITEM THE COMPANY REVIEWED FAS 154 ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND ERROR CORRECTIONS WHICH CARRIES FORWARD THE GUIDANCE IN APB OPINION NO. 20 ACCOUNTING CHANGES. IN PARAGRAPHS 25 - 26 FAS 154 OUTLINES THE STEPS NECESSARY FOR CORRECTING AND PROPERLY DISCLOSING AN ERROR IN PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOR MATERIAL ERRORS FAS 154 REQUIRES RESTATEMENT OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AFTER CONSIDERING THE GUIDANCE IN FAS 154 THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE EFFECT OF THE ERROR ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BENEFIT WAS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ANY INDIVIDUAL PRIOR PERIOD AND THAT THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR 2006 RESULTS. ACCORDINGLY WE RECORDED THE CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENT IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006 WHICH INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES BY 1.4 MILLION DURING THE QUARTER. IN FORMING OUR CONCLUSION ON MATERIALITY WE RELIED ON THE GUIDANCE PROVIDED IN SAB NO. 99 MATERIALITY. IN FOLLOWING THIS GUIDANCE WE THOROUGHLY CONSIDERED ALL RELEVANT QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS IN REACHING OUR CONCLUSION THAT THIS WAS AN IMMATERIAL ITEM. SOME OF THE QUANTITATIVE FACTORS CONSIDERED WERE AS FOLLOWS: _________________________________________________________________ SEPTEMBER 15 2006 PAGE 6 A. THE IMPACT OF THIS ERROR ON AN ANNUAL BASIS NEVER EXCEEDED 1 OF OUR GAAP REPORTED PRE-TAX INCOME FOR ANY YEAR FROM 1999 THROUGH 2004. B. THE IMPACT OF THE ERROR ON OUR 2005 PRE-TAX INCOME AFTER EXCLUDING CHARGES RELATED TO THE BANKRUPTCY FILINGS OF NORTHWEST AND MESABA AND A GAIN FROM THE REPURCHASE OF DEBT WAS ALSO LESS THAN 1.0 . C. BASED ON OUR CURRENTLY FORECASTED PRE-TAX INCOME FOR 2006 AFTER EXCLUDING BANKRUPTCY CHARGES OF 1.3 MILLION THE IMPACT OF CORRECTING THE ERROR IS 1.7 . SOME OF THE QUALITATIVE FACTORS CONSIDERED WERE AS FOLLOWS: A. THE MISSTATEMENT DID NOT HIDE A FAILURE TO MEET ANALYSTS EXPECTATIONS DUE TO THE IMMATERIALITY. B. THE MISSTATEMENT DID NOT CHANGE A LOSS TO INCOME OR VICE VERSA FOR ANY OF THE FISCAL YEARS IN QUESTION. C. THE MISSTATEMENT DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS. D. THE ERROR HAS NOT AFFECTED THE COMPANY S COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS COVENANTS UNDER DEBT OF SIMILAR AGREEMENTS OR CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS OF OPERATING AND OTHER AGREEMENTS. PLEASE DIRECT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CONCERNING THIS RESPONSE LETTER TO THE UNDERSIGNED AT (901) 348-4262. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE IN THIS MATTER. SINCERELY /S/ PETER D.
