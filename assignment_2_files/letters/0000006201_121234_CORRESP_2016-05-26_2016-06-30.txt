THE DOT AIRLINE REPORTING RULES FOR REVENUES BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION ARE BASED ON THE ORIGIN AND DESTINATION OF EACH FLIGHT.

ACCORDINGLY THE FOREIGN COMPONENT OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND THE ASSOCIATED INCOME TAX PROVISION HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN NOMINAL AND AS SUCH THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THE DISCLOSURE OF THESE AMOUNTS WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE READERS OF ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. _______________________________________________________________________ THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS ON OUR FOREIGN INCOME TAX FROM CHANGES IN OUR OPERATIONS AND CHANGES IN TAX LEGISLATION.

THIS RESULTED IN A 3 BILLION NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT RECORDED IN YOUR INCOME STATEMENT FOR 2015. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE REVERSAL PLEASE TELL US AND REVISE THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY RELATED TO INCOME TAXES IN MD A TO DISCUSS IN GREATER DETAIL THE NATURE OF THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT IN DETERMINING THE LIKELIHOOD THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL BE REALIZED IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE ENHANCED DISCLOSURE SHOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO ENABLE A READER TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET. SUCH INFORMATION MAY INCLUDE USE OF TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES EXPECTATIONS FOR FUTURE INCOME ETC. RESPONSE: THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS DISCLOSURES PROVIDED WITHIN ITS 2015 FORM 10-QS AND 2015 FORM 10-K ENABLE THE READER TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSET INCLUDING MANAGEMENT S CONSIDERATION OF ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE IN DETERMINING WHETHER A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WAS REQUIRED. THE FOLLOWING EVIDENCE WAS KEY TO MANAGEMENT S DETERMINATION THAT SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSET WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED: 1. LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF NET OPERATING LOSSES ( NOLS ): THE COMPANY S 8.0 BILLION OF NOLS COMPRISE A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSET. UPON EMERGENCE FROM BANKRUPTCY IN DECEMBER 2013 THE COMPANY MADE A TIMELY ELECTION TO BE COVERED BY SPECIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX RULES WHICH ALLOW FOR UTILIZATION OF ITS NOLS WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY LIMITATION THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN IMPOSED UNDER SECTION 382 PROVIDED THAT A SECOND OWNERSHIP CHANGE DID NOT OCCUR ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER 9 2015. NO SUCH SECOND OWNERSHIP CHANGE OCCURRED WITHIN THAT PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR NOLS ARE EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE FOR USE WITHOUT ANY LIMITATION UNDER SECTION 382. 2. MERGER INTEGRATION RISKS: THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO GENERATE FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME WAS DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF CERTAIN CRITICAL MERGER INTEGRATION MILESTONES. THE LAST OF THESE CRITICAL MERGER MILESTONES THE INTEGRATION OF THE LEGACY AMERICAN AIRLINES AND US AIRWAYS PASSENGER RESERVATIONS SYSTEMS WAS COMPLETED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015. 3. SUSTAINED FUTURE PROFITABILITY: IN ADDITION TO THE MERGER RISKS DESCRIBED ABOVE THE COMPANY ALSO EVALUATED OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. KEY RISKS INCLUDED THE HEALTH OF THE ECONOMY THE LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF FUEL PRICES AND THE STATE OF TRAVEL DEMAND ALL OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY S CONTROL. 2 _______________________________________________________________________ THESE SPECIFIC FORM 10-Q AND 10-K DISCLOSURES ARE INCLUDED BELOW: NOLS WITH RESPECT TO NOLS DISCLOSURE REGARDING ANY LIMITATIONS ON USE OF THE COMPANY S 8.0 BILLION OF NOLS IS INCLUDED WITHIN MD A RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (PAGE 65) IN ITS FORM 10-K AS FOLLOWS: AT DECEMBER 31 2015 WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 8.0 BILLION OF GROSS NOL CARRYFORWARDS TO REDUCE FUTURE FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE FOR USE IN 2016. THE FEDERAL NOL CARRYFORWARDS WILL EXPIRE BEGINNING IN 2023 IF UNUSED...... OUR ABILITY TO DEDUCT OUR NOL CARRYFORWARDS AND TO UTILIZE CERTAIN OTHER AVAILABLE TAX ATTRIBUTES CAN BE SUBSTANTIALLY CONSTRAINED UNDER THE GENERAL ANNUAL LIMITATION RULES OF SECTION 382 WHERE AN OWNERSHIP CHANGE HAS OCCURRED. WE EXPERIENCED AN OWNERSHIP CHANGE IN CONNECTION WITH OUR EMERGENCE FROM THE CHAPTER 11 CASES AND US AIRWAYS GROUP EXPERIENCED AN OWNERSHIP CHANGE IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER. AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER US AIRWAYS GROUP IS NOW INCLUDED IN THE AAG CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX RETURNS. THE GENERAL LIMITATION RULES OF SECTION 382 FOR A DEBTOR IN A BANKRUPTCY CASE ARE LIBERALIZED WHERE THE OWNERSHIP CHANGE OCCURS UPON EMERGENCE FROM BANKRUPTCY. WE ELECTED TO BE COVERED BY CERTAIN SPECIAL RULES FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES THAT PERMITTED APPROXIMATELY 9.0 BILLION (WITH 6.6 BILLION OF UNLIMITED NOL REMAINING AT DECEMBER 31 2015) OF OUR FEDERAL NOL CARRYFORWARDS TO BE UTILIZED WITHOUT REGARD TO THE SECTION 382 ANNUAL LIMITATION RULES UNLESS A SECOND OWNERSHIP CHANGE OCCURRED ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER 9 2015. NO SECOND OWNERSHIP CHANGE OCCURRED WITHIN THAT PERIOD. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR REMAINING FEDERAL NOL CARRYFORWARDS (ATTRIBUTABLE TO US AIRWAYS GROUP) ARE SUBJECT TO LIMITATION UNDER SECTION 382 HOWEVER OUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE SUCH NOL CARRYFORWARDS IS NOT ANTICIPATED TO BE EFFECTIVELY CONSTRAINED AS A RESULT OF SUCH LIMITATION............................................ IN CONNECTION WITH THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015 WE DETERMINED THAT IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHICH INCLUDE OUR NOLS WOULD BE REALIZED. ACCORDINGLY WE REVERSED 3.0 BILLION OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31 2015 WHICH RESULTED IN A SPECIAL 3.0 BILLION NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOR 2015. BEGINNING IN 2016 WE EXPECT TO RECORD INCOME TAX EXPENSE WITH AN EFFECTIVE RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 38 WHICH WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY NON-CASH AS WE UTILIZE THE NOLS DESCRIBED ABOVE TO OFFSET CASH INCOME TAXES DUE. 3 _______________________________________________________________________ MERGER INTEGRATION RISKS AND SUSTAINED FUTURE PROFITABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE CONSIDERATION OF MERGER INTEGRATION RISKS AND FUTURE SUSTAINED PROFITABILITY IN LEADING UP TO THE REVERSAL OF THE COMPANY S VALUATION ALLOWANCE AT DECEMBER 31 2015 THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURE WAS INCLUDED IN EACH OF THE COMPANY S 2015 FORM 10-Q FILINGS IN BOTH ITS MD A RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ALSO IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENT INCOME TAX FOOTNOTE.
