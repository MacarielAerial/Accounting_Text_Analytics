RESPONSE: SIMILAR TO MANY OTHER AIRLINES WE SELL VACATION PACKAGES WHICH TYPICALLY INCLUDE HOTEL CAR RENTAL AND OTHER SERVICES IN ADDITION TO AIRFARE. THE AIRFARE COMPONENT OF THE VACATION PACKAGE IS RECORDED AS PASSENGER REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1. THE NON-AIRFARE RELATED REVENUES ARE RECORDED IN OTHER REVENUE WHEN THE UNDERLYING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. TOTAL JETBLUE GETAWAYS REVENUES REPRESENT LESS THAN 1 OF ALL REVENUES AND THE INDIVIDUAL AIRFARE AND NON-AIRFARE PORTIONS REPRESENT LESS THAN 1 OF PASSENGER REVENUE AND OTHER REVENUE RESPECTIVELY.

SHOULD THIS ACTIVITY BECOME A MATERIAL PART OF OUR OPERATIONS WE WILL INCLUDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE RELATED TO THE REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

EXCLUDING OUR AUCTION RATE SECURITIES WHICH WERE TRANSFERRED FROM THE AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE CATEGORY TO THE TRADING CATEGORY AT THE END OF 2008 AND FOR WHICH WE HAVE EXTENSIVE DISCLOSURE INCLUDED IN NOTE 14 OUR REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FOR ALL INVESTMENT SECURITIES AS OF ANY DATE OR FOR ANY PERIOD PRESENTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE NEVER GREATER THAN 1 MILLION WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE IMMATERIAL. AS A RESULT MANY OF __________________________________________________________________ THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF ASC 320-10-50 THAT PERTAIN TO REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AS WELL AS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COST BASIS AND FAIR VALUE HAVE BEEN OMITTED ON THE BASIS OF MATERIALITY.
