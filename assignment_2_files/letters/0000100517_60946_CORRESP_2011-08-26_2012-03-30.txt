( UAL ) UNITED AIR LINES INC. ( UNITED ) AND CONTINENTAL AIRLINES INC. ( CONTINENTAL ) AND TOGETHER WITH UAL AND UNITED (THE COMPANY ) FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2010 (THE 2010 FORM 10-K ) AND FORM 10-Q FOR THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30 2011 (THE SECOND QUARTER 2011 FORM 10-Q ) AS SET FORTH IN THE STAFF S LETTER DATED AUGUST 17 2011. FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE THE STAFF S COMMENT IS REPEATED BELOW IN BOLD WITH THE COMPANY S RESPONSE TO THE COMMENT SET FORTH IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER. 77 W. WACKER DRIVE CHICAGO IL 60601 1 _______________________________________________________________________ LOGO FORM 10-K FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2010 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FREQUENT FLYER AWARDS PAGE 63 1. WE NOTE THAT PRIOR TO THE MERGER BETWEEN UAL AND CONTINENTAL UNITED AND CONTINENTAL MAINTAINED THEIR OWN FREQUENT FLYER LOYALTY PROGRAM. BASED UPON RECENT NEWS ARTICLES IT APPEARS THAT THE UNITED AND CONTINENTAL S FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAMS WILL BE FULLY MERGED AS OF JANUARY 1 2012 WITH UNITED S MILEAGE PLUS PROGRAM SURVIVING AS THE COMPANY S SINGLE LOYALTY PLAN. BASED UPON YOUR DISCLOSURE IN CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THE PROGRAM RULES RELATED TO UNITED S LOYALTY PROGRAM HAVE HISTORICALLY DIFFERED FROM THE PROGRAM RULES OF CONTINENTAL S LOYALTY PROGRAM. FOR EXAMPLE YOU SPECIFICALLY DISCLOSE THAT MILES EARNED UNDER UNITED S PROGRAM HAVE HISTORICALLY EXPIRED AFTER EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF INACTIVITY WHEREAS MILES EARNED UNDER CONTINENTAL S PROGRAM DID NOT HISTORICALLY EXPIRE. WHILE WE NOTE THAT BOTH UNITED AND CONTINENTAL HAVE HISTORICALLY RECOGNIZED BREAKAGE FOR MILEAGE CREDITS THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE REDEEMED IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE EXPECTED RATE OF BREAKAGE OR TIMING OF RECOGNITION WAS SIMILAR FOR EACH ENTITY S PROGRAM -PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE DIFFERENCE IN THE MILEAGE CREDIT EXPIRATION POLICIES APPLIED BY EACH PROGRAM. IN THIS REGARD PLEASE TELL US WHETHER THE MERGING OF UNITED AND CONTINENTAL S LOYALTY PROGRAMS IS EXPECTED TO MATERIALLY IMPACT THE PROGRAMS RESPECTIVE DEFERRED REVENUE BALANCES OR THE TIMING OF BREAKAGE RECOGNITION FOR EITHER PROGRAM. IN ADDITION TELL US WHETHER PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS ABILITY TO LINK THEIR MILEAGE CREDITS FROM EACH PROGRAM HAS OR IS LIKELY TO IMPACT YOUR ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF BREAKAGE THAT IS CONTAINED IN THE AGGREGATED POPULATION OF OUTSTANDING MILES. IN THIS REGARD IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE PARTICIPANTS ABILITY TO LINK THEIR INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM ACCOUNTS MAY EFFECTIVELY RESULT IN A GREATER NUMBER OF FULLY EARNED AWARDS OUTSTANDING. LASTLY TELL US WHETHER THE MERGING OF THE LOYALTY PROGRAMS OR ANY ANTICIPATED CHANGES TO EITHER PROGRAM S RULES/POLICIES IS EXPECTED TO IMPACT ANY OF YOUR OTHER ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES. BASED UPON YOUR RESPONSE PLEASE CONSIDER WHETHER YOUR MD A SHOULD BE REVISED IN FUTURE FILINGS TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE OR QUALITATIVE INFORMATION REGARDING THE IMPACT OF MERGING YOUR LOYALTY PLANS. RESPONSE. AS DISCLOSED IN THE SECOND QUARTER 2011 FORM 10-Q THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT THE LOYALTY PROGRAMS OF UNITED AND CONTINENTAL WILL BE MERGING INTO ONE PROGRAM WITH UNITED S MILEAGEPLUS PROGRAM BEING THE SURVIVING LOYALTY PROGRAM. THE COMPANY HAS YET TO FINALIZE ANY SPECIFIC POLICIES FOR THE COMBINED PROGRAM INCLUDING THE EXPIRATION POLICY. BOTH COMPANIES CALCULATE A RATE FOR MILEAGE CREDITS NOT EXPECTED TO REDEEM (OR BREAKAGE RATE ). THE BREAKAGE RATE USED BY EACH PROGRAM IN THE REVENUE RECOGNITION PROCESS FOR 2011 IS VERY SIMILAR WITH A DIFFERENCE OF ONE PERCENTAGE POINT. ALTHOUGH CONTINENTAL HAS 77 W. WACKER DRIVE CHICAGO IL 60601 2 _______________________________________________________________________ LOGO NO EXPIRATION POLICY A THIRD PARTY ACTUARY HAS ASSISTED US WITH ESTIMATING A BREAKAGE RATE BASED ON COMPANY SPECIFIC CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THAT INDICATES WHEN IT IS REMOTE THAT THE CUSTOMER WILL REQUIRE PERFORMANCE. THIS AMOUNT OF BREAKAGE CAN BE OBJECTIVELY AND RELIABLY ESTIMATED USING COMPANY SPECIFIC HISTORICAL EVIDENCE. UNITED S BREAKAGE RATE IS BASED ON ACTUAL EXPIRATIONS OF MILES IN CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. ONCE WE FINALIZE THE POLICIES FOR THE COMBINED PROGRAMS INCLUDING POLICIES REGARDING EXPIRATION WE WILL EVALUATE THE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS FROM ANY CHANGES IN THE PROGRAM AND MAKE APPROPRIATE DISCLOSURES. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THERE WILL BE MATERIAL CHANGES IN BREAKAGE DUE TO THE FINAL EXPIRATION POLICIES. WE EXPECT THE COMBINED MILEAGEPLUS POLICY DECISIONS TO BE MADE BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT ACCOUNTING PAGE 68 2. PLEASE DISCLOSE THE AMOUNTS BY WHICH YOUR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT LIABILITY AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE COULD BE EXPECTED TO CHANGE IF YOUR ESTIMATE OF THE APPLICABLE DISCOUNT RATE WAS REDUCED. RESPONSE. UAL S WEIGHTED AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO DETERMINE ITS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31 2010 WAS 5.13 . A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE IN THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE UAL S POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT LIABILITY AT DECEMBER 31 2010 BY APPROXIMATELY 290 MILLION AND INCREASE THE ESTIMATED 2011 BENEFITS EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY 20 MILLION. GIVEN THE IMMATERIALITY WE DO NOT CONSIDER THIS A REQUIRED DISCLOSURE AND WILL EVALUATE THIS FOR DISCLOSURE IN OUR FUTURE FORM 10-K FILINGS. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY PRICE RISK (AIRCRAFT FUEL) FUEL COSTS PAGE 72 3. YOUR TABULAR DISCLOSURE SUGGESTS THAT A 1 INCREASE IN THE PRICE PER BARREL OF FUEL WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE RATHER THAN AN INCREASE IN THE ANNUAL FUEL EXPENSE OF UAL UNITED AND CONTINENTAL. BASED UPON FOOTNOTE (B) TO YOUR TABLE IT APPEARS THAT THIS DECREASE IN EACH ENTITY S ABSOLUTE FUEL COSTS MAY REFLECT THE COMBINED EFFECT OF THE ASSUMED 1 INCREASE IN THE PRICE PER BARREL OF FUEL AND A PROJECTED DECREASE IN FUEL CONSUMPTION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011. HOWEVER GIVEN THAT THE PURPOSE OF YOUR TABLE IS TO DEMONSTRATE YOUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE OF FUEL (I.E. ON AN ISOLATED BASIS) PLEASE REVISE YOUR DISCLOSURE TO QUANTIFY THE HYPOTHETICAL IMPACT OF A 1 INCREASE IN THE PRICE PER BARREL OF FUEL ON YOUR FISCAL YEAR 2010 FUEL EXPENSE OR ADVISE. IN ADDITION PLEASE CONFIRM FOR US WHETHER OR NOT THE SENSITIVITY DATA CURRENTLY PRESENTED IN YOUR TABLE DOES IN FACT ASSUME A DECLINE IN UAL S FUEL CONSUMPTION 77 W. WACKER DRIVE CHICAGO IL 60601 3 _______________________________________________________________________ LOGO FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011. IF SO PLEASE TELL US THE AMOUNT OF THE PROJECTED DECLINE IN FUEL CONSUMPTION AND THE FACTORS THAT YOU EXPECT TO DRIVE THIS DECLINE (E.G. REDUCTION IN CAPACITY). IN ADDITION TELL US HOW THE CONSOLIDATION OF CONTINENTAL FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR OF 2011 VERSUS ONE QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2010 WAS FACTORED INTO THE FUEL PROJECTIONS USED TO DETERMINE YOUR SENSITIVITY DATA. FINALLY TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU EXPECT A MATERIAL REDUCTION IN FUEL CONSUMPTION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011 PLEASE EXPAND MD A TO DISCUSS ALL RELATED BUSINESS TRENDS -INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FACTORS EXPECTED TO DIRECTLY IMPACT CONSUMPTION LEVELS. RESPONSE. A 1 INCREASE IN THE PRICE PER BARREL OF FUEL WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE ANNUAL FUEL EXPENSE OF UAL UNITED AND CONTINENTAL OF 99 MILLION 57 MILLION AND 42 MILLION RESPECTIVELY FOR 2011. THE TABULAR DISCLOSURE OF THE INCREASE IN ANNUAL FUEL EXPENSE WAS MEANT TO DENOTE A NEGATIVE IMPACT TO EARNINGS AND WAS NOT MEANT TO DENOTE A DECREASE IN ANNUAL FUEL EXPENSE FROM A 1 INCREASE IN THE PRICE PER BARREL OF FUEL. WE WILL CHANGE THE PRESENTATION IN THE TABULAR DISCLOSURE IN FUTURE FORM 10-K FILINGS. THE HYPOTHETICAL IMPACT OF A 1 INCREASE IN THE PRICE PER BARREL ON FUEL EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2010 WOULD BE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS): UAL (1) UNITED CONTINENTAL FUEL GALLONS CONSUMED (IN MILLIONS) 2 798 2 390 1 681 FUEL BARRELS CONSUMED (IN MILLIONS) 67 57 40 1 INCREASE IN THE PRICE PER BARREL ON ANNUAL BASIS 67 57 40 (1) UAL INCLUDES ONLY THE FOURTH QUARTER 2010 RESULTS FOR CONTINENTAL. AS A RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FUEL EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2010 IS NOT COMPARABLE TO EXPECTED 2011 ANNUAL FUEL EXPENSE FOR UAL SINCE CONTINENTAL S FUEL EXPENSE WAS ONLY INCLUDED IN THE UAL STATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS FOR PERIODS ON OR AFTER OCTOBER 1 2010 AND EXCLUDES FUEL EXPENSE FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO OCTOBER 1 2010. THEREFORE ON A PRO FORMA BASIS THE HYPOTHETICAL IMPACT OF A 1 INCREASE IN THE PRICE PER BARREL ON FUEL EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2010 WOULD BE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS): UAL UNITED CONTINENTAL FUEL GALLONS CONSUMED (IN MILLIONS) 4 071 2 390 1 681 FUEL BARRELS CONSUMED (IN MILLIONS) 97 57 40 1 INCREASE IN THE PRICE PER BARREL ON ANNUAL BASIS 97 57 40 WE NOTE THAT ITEM 305(A)(1)(II)(A) OF REGULATION S-K REQUIRES SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS DISCLOSURES THAT EXPRESS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN FUTURE EARNINGS FAIR VALUES OR CASH FLOWS OF MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS RESULTING FROM ONE OR MORE SELECTED HYPOTHETICAL 77 W. WACKER DRIVE CHICAGO IL 60601 4 _______________________________________________________________________ LOGO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COMMODITY PRICES AND OTHER RELEVANT MARKET RATES OR PRICES OVER A SELECTED PERIOD OF TIME. WE COMPUTED THE HYPOTHETICAL 1 INCREASE IN THE PRICE PER BARREL OF FUEL ON ANNUAL FUEL EXPENSE BASED ON THE EXPECTED FUTURE CONSUMPTION FOR THE YEAR FOLLOWING THE MOST RECENTLY COMPLETED FISCAL YEAR. THEREFORE A HYPOTHETICAL 1 INCREASE IN THE PRICE PER BARREL OF FUEL BASED ON 2011 EXPECTED FUEL CONSUMPTION WOULD RESULT IN THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN FUTURE EARNINGS OR AN INCREASE IN 2011 ANNUAL FUEL EXPENSE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS): UAL UNITED CONTINENTAL FUEL GALLONS CONSUMED (IN MILLIONS) 4 148 2 380 1 768 FUEL BARRELS CONSUMED (IN MILLIONS) 99 57 42 1 INCREASE IN THE PRICE PER BARREL ON ANNUAL BASIS ^(A) 99 57 42 (A) AS DISCLOSED IN THE COMPANY S 2010 FORM 10-K. AS INDICATED IN THE TABLES ABOVE THE COMPANY IS NOT ASSUMING A DECLINE IN UAL S FUEL CONSUMPTION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL DATA STATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS PAGE 80 4. PLEASE REFER TO THE 64 MILLION GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CREDIT THAT IS REFLECTED IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2010 STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS OF BOTH UNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS INC. ( UAL ) AND UNITED AIR LINES INC ( UNITED ). BASED UPON YOUR MD A DISCLOSURE ON PAGE 46 OF YOUR FORM 10-K IT APPEARS THAT THE 64 MILLION CREDIT WAS RECORDED TO CORRECT THE OVERSTATEMENT OF YOUR DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES (I.E. AN ERROR) THAT OCCURRED WHEN YOU APPLIED FRESH START ACCOUNTING. IN THIS REGARD WE NOTE THAT YOU CORRECTED THIS ERROR IN UAL AND UNITED S FISCAL YEAR 2010 STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS RATHER THAN IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ERROR ORIGINALLY OCCURRED AS YOU DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE CORRECTION WAS MATERIAL TO THE CURRENT OR ANY PRIOR PERIOD. GIVEN THAT NEITHER UAL NOR UNITED APPEARS TO HAVE RECOGNIZED INCOME TAX EXPENSE DURING FISCAL YEAR 2010 IT APPEARS THAT THE CORRECTION OF THE ERROR IN SUCH PERIOD MAY HAVE INCREASED BOTH UAL AND UNITED S REPORTED NET INCOME BY THE ENTIRE 64 MILLION. IF SO THE 64 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CREDIT WOULD REFLECT (I) A 33.9 INCREASE TO THE NET INCOME OTHERWISE EARNED BY UAL (I.E. FROM 189 MILLION TO 253 MILLION) AND (II) A 19.1 INCREASE TO THE NET INCOME OTHERWISE EARNED BY UNITED (I.E. FROM 335 MILLION TO 399 MILLION). TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH AMOUNTS REFLECT THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF THE IMPAIRMENT CREDIT (I.E. THE CORRECTION OF THE ERROR) ON UAL AND UNITED S REPORTED NET INCOME FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010 YOUR DECISION TO CORRECT THE PRIOR PERIOD ERROR IN UAL AND UNITED S FISCAL YEAR 2010 STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS DOES NOT APPEAR TO COMPLY WITH THE GUIDANCE OUTLINED IN QUESTIONS 1 AND 2 OF SAB 108. UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES YOUR ACCOUNTING TREATMENT ALSO WOULD NOT APPEAR TO COMPLY WITH THE GENERAL GUIDANCE OUTLINED IN FASB ASC 250-10-45-23. 77 W. WACKER DRIVE CHICAGO IL 60601 5 _______________________________________________________________________ LOGO GIVEN THE OBSERVATIONS NOTED ABOVE WE BELIEVE THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO HAVE CORRECTED THE AFOREMENTIONED ERROR IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT PERIOD IN WHICH THE ERROR ORIGINALLY OCCURRED. AS SUCH PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US IN FURTHER DETAIL HOW YOU HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE IMPACT OF CORRECTING YOUR ERROR IN FISCAL YEAR 2010 WAS BOTH QUANTITATIVELY AND QUALITATIVELY IMMATERIAL AND PROVIDE US WITH A COPY OF YOUR MATERIALITY ANALYSIS. RESPONSE. DURING 2010 THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT IT OVERSTATED ITS DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES BY APPROXIMATELY 64 MILLION WHEN IT APPLIED FRESH START ACCOUNTING UPON ITS EXIT FROM CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN 2006. HAD THE COMPANY CORRECTED THIS ERROR IN 2006 IT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A REDUCTION TO DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION TO GOODWILL. AS A RESULT THE COMPANY S 2008 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF 2.3 BILLION WOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY 64 MILLION. THIS ADJUSTMENT WAS RECORDED DURING 2010 AS A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE (CREDIT) WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED HISTORICALLY. MANAGEMENT ANALYZED WHETHER IT SHOULD CONSIDER THE 64 MILLION ADJUSTMENT TO ITS DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY AS A CURRENT PERIOD ADJUSTMENT OR AS A CORRECTION OF AN ERROR IN PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ( EPFS ). THE ASC MASTER GLOSSARY DEFINES AN EPFS AS AN ERROR IN RECOGNITION MEASUREMENT PRESENTATION OR DISCLOSURE IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RESULTING FROM MATHEMATICAL MISTAKES MISTAKES IN THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) OR OVERSIGHT OR MISUSE OF FACTS THAT EXISTED AT THE TIME THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE PREPARED. A CHANGE FROM AN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE THAT IS NOT GENERALLY ACCEPTED TO ONE THAT IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED IS A CORRECTION OF AN ERROR. MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT IT SHOULD VIEW THE 64 MILLION DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT AS AN EPFS. AS PART OF THE COMPANY S CONSIDERATIONS UNDER SAB 99 MATERIALITY ( SAB 99 ) THE COMPANY EVALUATED THE ERROR FROM BOTH A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE PERSPECTIVE. MANAGEMENT S QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF THE MATERIALITY OF THE ERROR CONSIDERS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE ERROR ON NET INCOME. HOWEVER IN 2010 MANAGEMENT BELIEVED THAT NET INCOME WAS AT BREAK-EVEN LEVELS (NET INCOME REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 1 AND 2 OF UAL AND UNITED S REVENUES RESPECTIVELY). THEREFORE ANY AMOUNT MEASURED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET INCOME WOULD BE A RELATIVELY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF NET INCOME EVEN IF CONSIDERED IMMATERIAL BASED ON ALL OTHER QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE MEASURES. CONSEQUENTLY MANAGEMENT WEIGHTED OTHER MATERIALITY MEASUREMENTS MUCH MORE HEAVILY IN ITS EVALUATION AS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER INCOME FROM NORMAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXCLUDE SPECIAL ITEMS AS PART OF ITS ANALYSIS. WALL STREET ANALYSTS TYPICALLY FOCUS ON EARNINGS FROM CORE OPERATIONS AND EXCLUDE SPECIAL ITEMS FROM THEIR EARNINGS ESTIMATES. WE PROVIDE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS TO GAAP MEASURES TO ASSIST WITH THIS ANALYSIS. 77 W. WACKER DRIVE CHICAGO IL 60601 6 _______________________________________________________________________ LOGO BELOW IS THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS PERFORMED ON THE 64 MILLION ADJUSTMENT TO DETERMINE ITS MATERIALITY TO 2008 AND 2010 (IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PERCENTAGES): UAL NET INCOME (LOSS) SPECIAL ITEMS NET INCOME (LOSS) EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS ERROR CORRECTION PERCENTAGE OF NET INCOME (LOSS) EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS 2008 (5 396 ) (2 616 ) (2 780 ) 64 2.3 2010 253 (669 ) 922 64 6.9 UNITED NET INCOME (LOSS) SPECIAL ITEMS NET INCOME (LOSS) EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS ERROR CORRECTION PERCENTAGE OF NET INCOME (LOSS) EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS 2008 (5 354 ) (2 616 ) (2 738 ) 64 2.3 2010 399 (468 ) 867 64 7.4 UAL REVENUE UNITED REVENUE ERROR CORRECTION PERCENTAGE OF UAL REVENUE PERCENTAGE OF UNITED REVENUE 2008 20 194 20 237 64 0.3 0.3 2010 23 229 19 682 64 0.3 0.3 UAL TOTAL ASSETS TOTAL LIABILITIES TOTAL EQUITY PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL ASSETS PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL LIABILITIES PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL EQUITY 2008 19 465 21 786 (2 321 ) 0.3 0.3 2.8 2010 39 598 37 871 1 727 0.2 0.2 3.7 UNITED TOTAL ASSETS TOTAL LIABILITIES TOTAL EQUITY PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL ASSETS PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL LIABILITIES PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL EQUITY 2008 19 635 21 971 (2 336 ) 0.3 0.3 2.7 2010 19 688 21 665 (1 977 ) 0.3 0.3 3.2 ADJUSTING FOR SPECIAL ITEMS THE 64 MILLION ADJUSTMENT IS LESS THAN 7.5 OF NET INCOME (LOSS) EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS FOR ALL YEARS IMPACTED. WE DO NOT CONSIDER AMOUNTS THAT ARE 7.5 OR LESS OF NET INCOME OR NET INCOME EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS TO BE MATERIAL IN PERIODS WHEN NET INCOME IS AT OR NEAR BREAK-EVEN LEVELS (AS WAS THE CASE IN 2010). ADDITIONALLY IN PERIODS WHEN NET INCOME IS AT OR NEAR BREAK-EVEN WE ALSO BELIEVE EVALUATING AN ADJUSTMENT AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE IS RELEVANT. IN 2010 THE ERROR CORRECTION AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE IS 0.3 WHICH WE CONSIDER TO BE IMMATERIAL. THE ITEM WAS NON-CASH AND HAD NO IMPACT ON THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT FOR ANY YEAR PRESENTED. MANAGEMENT ALSO CONSIDERED THE VARIOUS FACTORS NOTED IN SAB 99 IN DETERMINING WHETHER OTHER QUALITATIVE FACTORS WOULD RENDER THE ERROR AS MATERIAL AND CONCLUDED THEY WERE NOT PRESENT IN ANY SIGNIFICANT MANNER. THOSE FACTORS AND OUR ASSESSMENT OF EACH ARE AS FOLLOWS: O THE MISSTATEMENT DID NOT MASK A CHANGE IN EARNINGS OR OTHER TRENDS -UAL AND UNITED HAD SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN ITS EARNINGS OVER THE PAST 3 YEARS 77 W. WACKER DRIVE CHICAGO IL 60601 7 _______________________________________________________________________ LOGO -NET INCOME (LOSS) FOR UAL FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31 2010 2009 AND 2008 WERE 253 MILLION (651) MILLION AND (5.4) BILLION -NET INCOME (LOSS) FOR UNITED FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31 2010 2009 AND 2008 WERE 399 MILLION (628) MILLION AND (5.4) BILLION O THE MISSTATEMENT DID NOT IMPACT ANALYSTS CONSENSUS EXPECTATIONS FOR THE ENTERPRISE -THE 64 MILLION WAS CATEGORIZED AS A SPECIAL CHARGE AND SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED ON THE FACE OF THE INCOME STATEMENT AND THEREFORE BACKED OUT OF ANALYST EXPECTATIONS -ANALYSTS INVESTORS AND OTHER FINANCIAL STATEMENT USERS ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON REVENUE PER AVAILABLE SEAT MILE AND COST PER AVAILABLE SEAT MILE PERFORMANCE AND RELATED TRENDS. THIS WAS A NON-CASH ADJUSTMENT TO GOODWILL AND THEREFORE DID NOT IMPACT THEIR KEY METRICS O THE MISSTATEMENT DID NOT CHANGE A LOSS INTO INCOME OR VICE VERSA O THE MISSTATEMENT DID NOT AFFECT OUR COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS O THE MISSTATEMENT DID NOT AFFECT OUR COMPLIANCE WITH LOAN COVENANTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS -THE COMPANY S FINANCIAL COVENANTS RELATED TO ITS DEBT AGREEMENTS GENERALLY EXCLUDE NON-CASH CHARGES SUCH AS THIS ONE O THE MISSTATEMENT DID NOT AFFECT MANAGEMENT S COMPENSATION -THE ADJUSTMENT INCREASED EARNINGS BUT COMPENSATION PLANS THAT ARE BASED ON NET INCOME EXCLUDED THE IMPACT OF THIS ERROR CORRECTION O THE MISSTATEMENT DID NOT INVOLVE CONCEALMENT OF AN UNLAWFUL TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT ALSO CONSIDERED THE VARIOUS FACTORS NOTED IN QUESTIONS 1 AND 2 OF SAB 108 CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS WHEN QUANTIFYING MISSTATEMENTS IN CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS ADJUSTMENT IS NOT MATERIAL (AS QUANTIFIED ABOVE) TO BOTH 2008 AND 2010 USING EITHER THE ROLLOVER OR IRON CURTAIN METHOD. THE AMOUNT OF THE ERROR DID NOT INCREMENTALLY OCCUR OVER TIME THEREFORE WE EVALUATED THE IMPACT OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE ERROR ON BOTH THE CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIODS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE ADJUSTMENT IS NOT MATERIAL THUS THE GUIDANCE IN FASB ASC 250-10-45-23 IS NOT APPLICABLE. MANAGEMENT PRESENTED THIS MATTER TO THE UAL AUDIT COMMITTEE ON JANUARY 25 2011. WE ALSO DISCUSSED THIS MATTER WITH OUR CURRENT AND PREDECESSOR AUDITORS (DIFFERENT AUDIT FIRM FOR 2008). WE CONCLUDED THAT THE ADJUSTMENT WAS NOT MATERIAL TO ANY AFFECTED YEARS AND WAS APPROPRIATELY RECORDED IN 2010. COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 -SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (B) REVENUE RECOGNITION PAGE 101 5. WITH REGARD TO THE MEASUREMENT AND RECOGNITION OF CHANGE FEES WE NOTE THAT YOUR DISCLOSURE SPECIFIES THAT THE PRICING OF THE CHANGE FEE AND THE INITIAL CUSTOMER ORDER 77 W. WACKER DRIVE CHICAGO IL 60601 8 _______________________________________________________________________ LOGO ARE SEPARATELY DETERMINED AND REPRESENT DISTINCT EARNINGS PROCESSES. HOWEVER WE ALSO NOTE THAT WHEN CHANGES AND/OR EXTENSIONS TO NON-REFUNDABLE TICKETS ARE PROCESSED AIRLINES OFTENTIMES REQUIRE THEIR PASSENGERS TO PAY ANY DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE PRICE OF THE ORIGINALLY ISSUED TICKET AND THE PRICE OF THE REPLACEMENT TICKET. IN THIS REGARD PLEASE TELL US AND REVISE YOUR DISCLOSURE TO SPECIFY AS APPROPRIATE WHETHER THE PROCEEDS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANY SUCH DIFFERENTIAL IN TICKET PRICE ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE ALONG WITH THE CHANGE FEE OR ARE DEFERRED ALONG WITH AMOUNTS RELATED TO THE INITIAL CUSTOMER ORDER UNTIL THE RELATED AIR TRANSPORTATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED. RESPONSE. AS DISCLOSED FEES CHARGED IN ASSOCIATION WITH CHANGES OR EXTENSIONS TO NON-REFUNDABLE TICKETS ARE RECORDED AS REVENUE AT THE TIME THE FEE IS CHARGED. THE FARE ON THE CHANGED TICKET INCLUDING ANY ADDITIONAL COLLECTION IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR TRANSPORTATION REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY AT THE TIME TRANSPORTATION IS PROVIDED. NOTE 17 -COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES PAGE 157 6. BASED UPON YOUR DISCLOSURE IN ITEM 3 OF YOUR FORM 10-K IT APPEARS THAT VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE INITIATED PROCEEDINGS AGAINST YOUR COMPANY ALLEGING THAT YOUR COMPANY HAS PARTICIPATED IN A PRICE-FIXING CONSPIRACY INVOLVING CERTAIN SURCHARGES. IN THIS REGARD WE ALSO NOTE THAT ON JANUARY 4 2010 THE ECONOMIC LAW SECRETARIAT OF BRAZIL ISSUED AN OPINION TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE COUNSEL OF ECONOMIC DEFENSE RECOMMENDING THAT CIVIL PENALTIES BE ASSESSED AGAINST ALL INVESTIGATED PARTIES INCLUDING UNITED. BASED UPON THE OBSERVATIONS NOTED ABOVE IT APPEARS THAT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A RELATED LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED COULD BE DEEMED REASONABLY POSSIBLE AS DEFINED IN THE GLOSSARY OF THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION. HOWEVER WE NOTE THAT THE PROCEEDINGS INITIATED BY THE VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES HAVE NOT BEEN DISCLOSED IN NOTE 17 TO YOUR FISCAL YEAR 2010 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN THIS REGARD PLEASE TELL US WHAT CONSIDERATION YOU GAVE TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED IN FASB ASC 450-20-50-3 THROUGH 50-5. ALTERNATIVELY REVISE YOUR FOOTNOTE DISCLOSURE TO DISCUSS THE NATURE OF THE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST YOUR COMPANY AS WELL AS YOUR EXPOSURE TO LOSS IF ESTIMABLE. LASTLY PLEASE TELL US THE AMOUNT OF THE CIVIL PENALTIES THAT THE ECONOMIC LAW SECRETARIAT OF BRAZIL HAS RECOMMENDED FOR ASSESSMENT AGAINST YOUR COMPANY IF KNOWN. RESPONSE. PURSUANT TO ITEM 103 OF REGULATION S-K OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AS AMENDED THE COMPANY PROVIDED DISCLOSURE ABOUT VARIOUS AIR CARGO/PASSENGER SURCHARGE INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED BY EACH OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (THE DOJ ) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND REGULATORY AGENCIES IN THE COUNTRIES OF NEW ZEALAND AND BRAZIL UNDER ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OF ITS 2010 FORM 10-K. WHILE THE COMPANY REGARDED SOME BUT NOT ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS AS MATERIAL PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS FOR WHICH DISCLOSURE WAS REQUIRED UNDER ITEM 103 THE COMPANY INCLUDED DISCLOSURE ON ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS IN ITEM 3 OF THE 2010 FORM 10-K DUE TO THEIR SIMILAR SCOPE AND SUBJECT MATTER. 77 W. WACKER DRIVE CHICAGO IL 60601 9 _______________________________________________________________________ LOGO AS ALSO DISCLOSED IN THE 2010 FORM 10-K UNITED WAS CONSIDERED A SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR THE AIR CARGO INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED BY THE DOJ AND WAS NOT CONSIDERED A TARGET WITH RESPECT TO A POSSIBLE PRICE FIXING CONSPIRACY. GIVEN THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INVESTIGATION THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT UNDER FASB ASC 450-20-50 THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A RELATED LOSS WOULD BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE DOJ INVESTIGATION WAS REMOTE AND THEREFORE NEITHER AN ACCRUAL FOR A LOSS CONTINGENCY NOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT DISCLOSURE WAS REQUIRED IN NOTE 17 -COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES OF THE 2010 FORM 10-K. CONSISTENT WITH THAT DETERMINATION THE COMPANY DISCLOSED IN ITS FORM 10-Q FOR THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31 2011 (THE FIRST QUARTER 2011 FORM 10-Q ) THAT THE DOJ S INVESTIGATION AS IT RELATED TO UNITED WAS EFFECTIVELY BROUGHT TO AN END AS OF FEBRUARY 15 2011. AS DISCLOSED IN THE 2010 FORM 10-K THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION DISMISSED UNITED FROM ITS PRICE-FIXING CARTEL INVESTIGATION ON NOVEMBER 12 2010. THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION INVESTIGATION IN ITS FORM 10-Q FOR THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30 2010 IN NOTE 13 -COMMITMENTS CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND UNCERTAINTIES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ITS DETERMINATION AT THE TIME OF THE FILING THAT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A RELATED LOSS WOULD BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INVESTIGATION WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE UNDER FASB ASC 450-20-50. HOWEVER AS A RESULT OF THE DISMISSAL OF THE INVESTIGATION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010 THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT WHILE DISCLOSURE WAS NECESSARY UNDER ITEM 3 OF THE 2010 FORM 10-K TO NOTE THE DISMISSAL UNDER FASB ASC 450-20-50 NEITHER AN ACCRUAL FOR A LOSS CONTINGENCY NOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT DISCLOSURE WAS REQUIRED IN NOTE 17 OF THE 2010 FORM 10-K. WITH RESPECT TO THE INVESTIGATION BY THE NEW ZEALAND COMMERCE COMMISSION THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT BASED ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INVESTIGATION AT THE TIME OF THE 2010 FORM 10-K FILING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A RELATED LOSS WOULD BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INVESTIGATION WAS REMOTE AND THEREFORE NEITHER AN ACCRUAL FOR A LOSS CONTINGENCY NOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT DISCLOSURE WAS REQUIRED UNDER NOTE 17 OF THE 2010 FORM 10-K. CONSISTENT WITH THIS DETERMINATION IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2011 FORM 10-Q THE COMPANY DISCLOSED THAT THE NEW ZEALAND COMMERCE COMMISSION DISCONTINUED ITS PROCEEDINGS AGAINST UNITED ON MARCH 18 2011 EFFECTIVELY WITHDRAWING ITS ALLEGATIONS OF WRONGDOING AND BRINGING THE INVESTIGATION TO AN END. WITH RESPECT TO THE INVESTIGATION IN BRAZIL ALTHOUGH THE ECONOMIC LAW SECRETARIAT OF BRAZIL ISSUED AN OPINION ON JANUARY 4 2010 RECOMMENDING THAT CIVIL PENALTIES BE ASSESSED AGAINST ALL PARTIES BEING INVESTIGATED INCLUDING UNITED AS OF THE DATE OF THE FILING OF THE 2010 FORM 10-K AND AS OF THE DATE OF THIS LETTER THE COMPANY IS STILL AWAITING THE OPINION OF THE FEDERAL PUBLIC PROSECUTOR ON WHETHER ITS OFFICE AGREES WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION. GIVEN THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INVESTIGATION THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A RELATED LOSS WOULD BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INVESTIGATION WAS REMOTE AND THEREFORE NEITHER AN ACCRUAL FOR A LOSS 77 W. WACKER DRIVE CHICAGO IL 60601 10 _______________________________________________________________________ LOGO CONTINGENCY NOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT DISCLOSURE WAS REQUIRED UNDER FASB ASC 450-20-50 IN NOTE 17 OF THE 2010 FORM 10-K. AS OF THE DATE OF THIS LETTER THE ECONOMIC LAW SECRETARIAT OF BRAZIL HAS NOT MADE A RECOMMENDATION AS TO THE SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF THE CIVIL PENALTIES PROPOSED TO BE ASSESSED AGAINST UNITED. CONTINGENT SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES PAGE 157 7. PLEASE REVISE YOUR FOOTNOTE DISCLOSURE REGARDING THE CONTINGENT SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES TO CLARIFY THE FOLLOWING: O CASH WILL NOT BE RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR ANY NOTES THAT YOU MAY BE REQUIRED TO ISSUE O ANY ISSUANCES OF THE NOTES WILL RESULT IN A CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN THE AMOUNT OF THE NOTES PRINCIPAL O UAL COMMON STOCK CAN ONLY BE ISSUED IN LIEU OF THE NOTES IF THE ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES WOULD CAUSE A DEFAULT UNDER OTHER SECURITIES THEN OUTSTANDING AND O SEMI-ANNUAL EBITDAR MEASUREMENTS COULD RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE OF UP TO TWO TRANCHES OF NOTES ON A SINGLE ISSUANCE DATE IN ADDITION PLEASE TELL US HOW YOU PLAN TO CLASSIFY THE PAYMENT OF SUCH LIABILITIES IN YOUR STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. RESPONSE. THE DISCLOSURE CONTAINED IN OUR 2010 FORM 10-K REFLECTED THAT A TRIGGERING EVENT REQUIRING THE ISSUANCE OF A TRANCHE OF THE 8 NOTES HAD NOT YET OCCURRED UNDER THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE 8 NOTES. WE BELIEVE OUR DISCLOSURE IN THE 2010 FORM 10-K WAS ADEQUATE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS: 1) A TRIGGERING EVENT (OR EVEN TWO TRIGGERING EVENTS IN A YEAR) WOULD NOT RESULT IN A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF PROCEEDS EVEN IF WE WERE GOING TO RECEIVE CASH 2) THE CHARGE TO EARNINGS UPON A TRIGGERING EVENT WILL BE CLASSIFIED AS MERGER-RELATED AND THEREFORE EXCLUDED FROM THE NET INCOME MEASUREMENT USED BY MOST ANALYSTS 3) WE CONSIDERED IT REMOTE AT THE TIME OF THE 2010 FORM 10-K FILING THAT ISSUING THE NOTES WOULD CAUSE US TO BE IN DEFAULT OF OUR OTHER SECURITIES AND 4) WE BELIEVE OUR DISCLOSURE ADEQUATELY DESCRIBES THAT THERE ARE POTENTIALLY TWO TRIGGERING EVENTS EACH YEAR. GIVEN THAT A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURRED ON JUNE 30 2011 WE WILL DISCLOSE THE CASH FLOW TREATMENT OF THE 8 NOTES AND THE OTHER ITEMS LISTED IN THE STAFF S COMMENT ABOVE IN OUR FUTURE FORM 10-K FILINGS. WE PLAN TO TREAT THE PAYMENT OF THE LIABILITIES ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE 8 NOTES AS PART OF OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. GUIDANCE FROM THE SEC IN MARCH 2005 ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF CASH FLOWS RELATED TO SETTLEMENTS WITH THE PBGC. ACCORDING TO THE GUIDANCE REGISTRANTS THAT REORGANIZE IN BANKRUPTCY OFTEN ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THE PBGC REGARDING THEIR LIABILITY UNDER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS THAT PROVIDE FOR A SETTLEMENT OF THE PLAN LIABILITY THROUGH AN ASSUMPTION BY THE PBGC. THE AGREEMENTS WITH THE PBGC TYPICALLY REQUIRE THAT PAYMENTS BE MADE BY THE REGISTRANT AT AND/OR SUBSEQUENT TO EMERGENCE FROM BANKRUPTCY FOR THE DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS THAT WERE ASSUMED BY THE PBGC. DESPITE THE FACT THAT PAYMENTS MADE TO THE PBGC PURSUANT TO THESE AGREEMENTS MAY CONTINUE FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE CASH OUTFLOWS SHOULD NOT BE CLASSIFIED AS FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. THE FORM OF SETTLEMENT OF THE PENSION LIABILITY DOES NOT CHANGE THE SUBSTANCE OF THE ACTIVITY FOR WHICH CASH IS BEING PAID TO ANY OTHER CLASSIFICATION THAN AS AN OPERATING ACTIVITY. 77 W.
