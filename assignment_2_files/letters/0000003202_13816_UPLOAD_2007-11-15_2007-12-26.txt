OCTOBER 23 2007 PAGE 2 SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA PAGE 27 AND MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS YEAR IN REVIEW PAGE 33 1. WE HAVE REVIEWED YOUR RESPONSE TO PRIOR COMMENTS 1 AND 2 AND NOTE THE FUTURE FILING REVISIONS YOU PROPOSE AS DISCUSSED IN THE FIRST TWO PARAGRAPHS OF YOUR RESPONSE TO PRIOR COMMENT 1. WITH RESPECT TO THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF YOUR RESPONSE TO PRIOR COMMENT 1 AS PERTAINING TO THE NON-GAAP MEASURE THAT WILL EXCLUDE FUEL AND REGIONAL FLYING COSTS WE DO NOT CONCUR WITH YOUR CONCLUSION THAT EXCLUSION OF THESE RECURRING COSTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH ITEM 10 OF REGULATION S-K AND QUESTION AND ANSWER NO. 8 OF THE STAFF S FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS REGARDING THE USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (THE FAQ ). WE BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING A SEPARATE DISCUSSION OF THE INDIVIDUAL IMPACT OF THESE TWO RECURRING COSTS SIMILAR TO YOUR PROPOSAL IN THE FIRST TWO PARAGRAPHS OF YOUR RESPONSE TO PRIOR COMMENT 1 CAN ACCOMPLISH THE SAME PURPOSE AS THE PROPOSED NARRATIVE DISCUSSION OF WHY YOU BELIEVE UNIT COST PERFORMANCE EXCLUDING FUEL AND BEGINNING IN 2007 COSTS INCURRED BY ALASKA AIRLINES ASSOCIATED WITH REGIONAL FLYING IS VITAL AND USEFUL TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS WITHOUT SEPARATELY RESULTING IN PRESENTING A NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURE. WHILE WE CANNOT ADDRESS SPECIFIC REGISTRANTS AND THEIR DISCLOSURES WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DESCRIBE IN YOUR RESPONSE DEMONSTRATE THAT PRESENTING A NON-GAAP MEASURE THAT EXCLUDES FUEL AND REGIONAL FLYING COSTS WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO AN INVESTOR IF NOT PROVIDED AS SUCH MEASURE(S) COULD BE READILY CALCULATED. AS SUCH FUTURE FILINGS SHOULD BE REVISED ACCORDINGLY. WE URGE ALL PERSONS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACCURACY AND ADEQUACY OF THE DISCLOSURE IN THE FILING TO BE CERTAIN THAT THE FILING INCLUDES ALL INFORMATION REQUIRED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND THAT THEY HAVE PROVIDED ALL INFORMATION INVESTORS REQUIRE FOR AN INFORMED INVESTMENT DECISION.
