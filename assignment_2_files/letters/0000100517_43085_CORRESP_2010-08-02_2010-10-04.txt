IT APPEARS YOU ARE PLANNING ON FILING A SHORT-FORM TAX OPINION. AS SUCH PLEASE DELETE THE PHRASE GENERAL SUMMARY IN THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THIS SECTION AS THE DISCUSSION IS COUNSEL S OPINION. THE APPLICABLE SENTENCE IN THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT HAS BEEN REVISED IN RESPONSE TO THIS COMMENT 15. PLEASE SEE PAGE 106 OF AMENDMENT NO. 1. NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (I) INTANGIBLE ASSETS PAGE 116 16. BASED UPON THE EXPLANATION THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED FOR THE ADJUSTMENT TO THE INTANGIBLE ASSET BALANCE (I.E. ADJUSTMENT I ) IN YOUR PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IT APPEARS THAT YOU MAY INTEND TO TREAT THE PURCHASE PRICE CONSIDERATION ALLOCATED TO TAKE-OFF AND LANDING SLOTS AS AN INDEFINITE-LIVED ASSET. HOWEVER BASED UPON FOOTNOTE 3 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN YOUR FISCAL YEAR 2009 FORM 10-K IT APPEARS THAT THE VALUE ASSIGNED TO AIRPORT SLOTS AND GATES IS SOMETIMES AMORTIZED. IN THIS REGARD PLEASE TELL US (I) THE FACTORS THAT YOU CONSIDER AND/OR ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU MAKE WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER THE VALUE ASSIGNED TO AIRPORT SLOTS AND GATES SHOULD BE AMORTIZED OR TREATED AS AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET AND (II) WHETHER ANY PORTION OF THE MERGER PURCHASE PRICE ASSIGNED TO TAKE-OFF AND LANDING SLOTS WILL BE AMORTIZED BASED UPON SUCH FACTORS OR ASSUMPTIONS. IN ADDITION TELL US THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF PURCHASE PRICE THAT YOU CURRENTLY PLAN TO ALLOCATE TO THE TAKE-OFF AND LANDING SLOTS. FOOTNOTE 3 OF THE COMPANY S 2009 FORM 10-K REFLECTS THE TOTAL NET BOOK VALUE OF AIRPORT SLOTS AND GATES TO BE 254 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31 2009 OF WHICH 35 MILLION WAS AMORTIZABLE. FOR UAL THE AIRPORT SLOTS THAT ARE BEING AMORTIZED ARE ALL AT U.S. AIRPORTS AND WERE RECOGNIZED AS PART OF FRESH-START ACCOUNTING IN 2006. IN ADDITION AIRPORT SLOTS AT INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS WERE ALL RECOGNIZED AS INDEFINITE-LIVED ASSETS IN THE COMPANY S HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOR THE DOMESTIC SLOTS AT FRESH-START THE COMPANY HAD NO SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS AT ANY AIRPORT AND NONE OF THESE SLOTS WERE AT THE COMPANY S HUB AIRPORTS AND AS SUCH THE COMPANY FOLLOWED HISTORICAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY PRACTICE IN DESIGNATING SUCH DOMESTIC SLOTS AS FINITE-LIVED ASSETS. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATED TO CONTINENTAL S TAKE-OFF AND LANDING SLOTS IS ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 1 BILLION. A SUMMARY OF THE VALUATIONS AND THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES IS AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS): AMOUNT LIFE NEWARK LIBERTY AIRPORT SLOTS 497 INDEFINITE INTERNATIONAL SLOTS 455 INDEFINITE OTHER U.S. AIRPORT SLOTS 72 FINITE 5 _______________________________________________________________________ ACCOUNTING RULES (ASC 350-30-35) INDICATE THAT FACTORS SUCH AS THE EXPECTED USE OF THE ASSET OR RELATED ASSETS ARE AMONG THE FACTORS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IN DETERMINING THE USEFUL LIFE OF AN INTANGIBLE ASSET. FURTHERMORE IF NO LEGAL REGULATORY CONTRACTUAL COMPETITIVE ECONOMIC OR OTHER FACTORS LIMIT THE USEFUL LIFE OF AN INTANGIBLE ASSET TO THE REPORTING ENTITY THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET SHALL BE CONSIDERED TO BE INDEFINITE. SIMILAR TO THE TREATMENT OF INTERNATIONAL SLOTS RECOGNIZED AS INDEFINITE-LIVED ASSETS BY UAL AT FRESH-START CONTINENTAL S INTERNATIONAL SLOTS ARE LOCATED AT HIGH-DEMAND AIRPORTS WITH SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING RESTRICTIONS AND THE COMPANY HAS NO FORESEEABLE EXPECTATION FOR CHANGE IN THESE RESTRICTIONS. AT NEWARK LIBERTY AIRPORT THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION AND DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAVE HISTORICALLY TREATED THE AIRPORT AS HIGH DENSITY AND HAVE ESTABLISHED A FIXED NUMBER OF TAKE-OFF AND LANDING SLOTS RESTRICTING THE AMOUNT OF FLIGHTS AT THIS AIRPORT AND THE OTHER TWO NEW YORK-AREA AIRPORTS (JOHN F. KENNEDY AND LA GUARDIA). CONTINENTAL UTILIZES NEWARK LIBERTY (OPERATING APPROXIMATELY 70 OF THE TOTAL DAILY DEPARTURES FROM THE AIRPORT) AS A HUB AIRPORT AND HAS A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE AIRPORT FACILITIES WITH CORRESPONDING LONG-TERM LEASES. A KEY ELEMENT OF THE COMPANY S LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOLLOWING THE MERGER IS TO REMAIN FIRST OR SECOND IN MARKET SHARE IN THE REGIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES. CONTINENTAL S NEWARK LIBERTY HUB IS ESSENTIAL TO THAT STRATEGY FROM BOTH A DOMESTIC PERSPECTIVE AND CRITICALLY AS THE COMBINED COMPANY S PRIMARY U.S. GATEWAY TO EUROPE. ACCORDINGLY THE COMPANY PLANS TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE AS A HUB IN NEWARK LIBERTY INDEFINITELY. THE COMPANY IS NOT AWARE OF ANY LEGAL REGULATORY CONTRACTUAL COMPETITIVE ECONOMIC OR OTHER FACTORS LIMITING THE LIFE OF THE COMPANY S NEWARK OPERATIONS AND AS SUCH THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES TREATING THESE SLOTS AT NEWARK LIBERTY AS INDEFINITE-LIVED ASSETS. CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY S CURRENT ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR DOMESTIC SLOTS THE COMPANY PLANS TO TREAT THE REMAINING CONTINENTAL SLOTS AT NON-HUB U.S. AIRPORTS AS FINITE-LIVED ASSETS. 17. PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US WHY YOUR PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENT TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS ONLY RESULTED IN AN 8 MILLION PRO FORMA INCREASE TO AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31 2010 GIVEN THAT IT RESULTED IN A 66 MILLION PRO FORMA INCREASE TO AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2009. AS PART OF YOUR RESPONSE TELL US (I) WHAT PORTION OF YOUR 2.2 BILLION PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENT IS EXPECTED TO BE ALLOCATED TO AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND (II) THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OVER WHICH YOU PLAN/EXPECT TO AMORTIZE SUCH BALANCE. THE COMPANY HAS REVISED ITS ESTIMATES OF AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THEIR USEFUL LIVES AND HAS UPDATED ITS PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED BALANCE SHEET AS OF JUNE 30 2010 AND THE PRO FORMA STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2009 AND FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30 2010. THE REVISED PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENT FOR INTANGIBLE ASSET AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2009 AND THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30 2010 IS AN INCREASE IN EXPENSE OF 97 MILLION AND 37 MILLION RESPECTIVELY. THE REVISED ADJUSTMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2009 IS STILL HIGHER THAN THE ANNUALIZED REVISED AMOUNT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30 2010 AS CERTAIN OF THE AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE FULLY AMORTIZED 6 _______________________________________________________________________ WITHIN ONE YEAR AND OTHERS ARE EXPECTED TO BE AMORTIZED USING AN ACCELERATED AMORTIZATION METHOD THAT REFLECTS THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT OF THE ASSET CONSISTENT WITH ASC 350-30-35-6. THESE ARE PRIMARILY CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED FROM CONTINENTAL S CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS VALUED USING THE INCOME APPROACH WITH AN ATTRITION RATE RESULTING IN A DISSIPATION OF THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS OVER TIME. THE PORTION OF THE PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENT AS OF JUNE 30 2010 TO RECORD AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS 583 MILLION. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OF AMORTIZATION IS APPROXIMATELY SIX YEARS. (R) CONTINENTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY PAGE 118 18. WE NOTE THAT YOUR UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2009 INCLUDES A 404 MILLION ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT LOWER AIRCRAFT FUEL EXPENSES RELATED TO CONTINENTAL S FUEL HEDGE LOSSES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) BUT WILL BE ELIMINATED UPON THE APPLICATION OF ACQUISITION METHOD ACCOUNTING. IN THIS REGARD IT IS UNCLEAR TO US WHY YOU BELIEVE THAT THE ELIMINATION OF THE NET ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS BALANCE RELATED TO CONTINENTAL S PRIOR FUEL HEDGE ACTIVITY WOULD HAVE A CONTINUING IMPACT ON POST-MERGER (I.E. COMBINED COMPANY S) RESULTS. FURTHERMORE IT IS UNCLEAR WHY FUEL HEDGE LOSSES THAT WERE DEFERRED BY CONTINENTAL (I.E. NOT EXPENSED IN THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS) WOULD RESULT IN A PRO FORMA REDUCTION TO FUEL COSTS IN THE COMBINED COMPANY S PRO FORMA STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. PLEASE EXPLAIN THE REASON FOR YOUR ADJUSTMENT OR REVISE. IN ADDITION TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT YOUR PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENT IS APPROPRIATE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US WHY A SIMILAR ADJUSTMENT WAS NOT REQUIRED IN THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31 2010. AS DISCLOSED IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE HEAD NOTE TO THE PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON PAGE 111 OF AMENDMENT NO. 1 THE COMPANY HAS PREPARED THESE PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE MERGER AS IF IT HAD BEEN CONSUMMATED ON JANUARY 1 2009 THE BEGINNING OF THE EARLIEST PERIOD PRESENTED AS REQUIRED BY RULE 11-02 OF REGULATION S-X. AS OF THAT DATE CONTINENTAL HAD DEFERRED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME 404 MILLION OF LOSSES ON FUEL HEDGE CONTRACTS THAT CONTINENTAL HAD ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES PURSUANT TO ASC 815 DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. BECAUSE ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING RESULTS IN THE ELIMINATION OF THE BALANCE OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE GAIN AND LOSS GIVEN THAT SUCH DEFERRED ITEMS HAVE NO FAIR VALUE AT THE ACQUISITION DATE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE SUBSEQUENT RECOGNITION OF THESE LOSSES (WHICH WERE RECORDED AS PART OF HISTORICAL AIRCRAFT FUEL EXPENSE DURING 2009) SHOULD BE ELIMINATED IN THE PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SIMILAR TREATMENT IN THE PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WAS AFFORDED TO THE PENSION AND POST RETIREMENT BENEFIT PRIOR SERVICE COST AND ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES DEFERRED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ON THE ASSUMED ACQUISITION DATE OF JANUARY 1 2009. NO FUEL-RELATED ADJUSTMENT WAS REFLECTED IN THE PRO FORMA QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31 2010 AS ALL OF THE DEFERRED FUEL HEDGE LOSSES AT JANUARY 1 2009 RELATED TO FUEL HEDGE CONTRACTS WHICH WERE SETTLED BY THE END OF 2009. 7 _______________________________________________________________________ WHERE YOU CAN FIND INFORMATION PAGE 139 19.

EXHIBIT 8.1 21. PLEASE HAVE COUNSEL EITHER REVISE ITS OPINION TO DELETE THE SECOND AND THIRD SENTENCES OF THE LAST PARAGRAPH ON PAGE 1 OR CONFIRM THAT IT WILL REFILE THE OPINION DATED THE DATE OF EFFECTIVENESS. IN RESPONSE TO THIS COMMENT 21 COUNSEL FOR EACH OF UAL AND CONTINENTAL HAVE PROVIDED A FORM TAX OPINION TO BE FILED WITH THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND HAVE CONFIRMED THAT SUCH OPINION WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY REFILED AND DATED THE DATE OF EFFECTIVENESS. PLEASE SEE EXHIBITS 8.1 AND 8.2 OF AMENDMENT NO. 1. 22. PLEASE HAVE COUNSEL REVISE THE FIRST PARAGRAPH ON THE SECOND PAGE TO CLEARLY STATE THAT THE DISCUSSION IN THE MATERIAL TAX CONSEQUENCES SECTION OF THE PROSPECTUS IS COUNSEL S OPINION. IT IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE SHORT-FORM OPINION TO STATE THAT THE STATEMENTS IN THE PROSPECTUS ARE AN ACCURATE SUMMARY OR DISCUSSION OF THE TAX CONSEQUENCES. THE APPLICABLE PARAGRAPH IN THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT HAS BEEN REVISED IN RESPONSE TO THIS COMMENT 22. PLEASE SEE EXHIBIT 8.1 OF AMENDMENT NO. 1. 8 _______________________________________________________________________ FORM 10-K ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OPERATING REVENUES PAGE 42 23. WHILE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE STATISTICAL AND UNIT MEASUREMENTS PROVIDED IN YOUR MD A DISCLOSURE PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INFORMATION REGARDING THE PERIOD-TO-PERIOD CHANGES IN YOUR PASSENGER REVENUE WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT YOUR DISCLOSURE COULD BE FURTHER ENHANCED BY DIRECTLY ADDRESSING FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS CARRIED AND CHANGES IN AVERAGE TICKET PRICE. PLEASE EXPAND YOUR DISCLOSURE ACCORDINGLY OR ADVISE. IN ADDITION PLEASE PROVIDE YOUR PROPOSED EXPANDED DISCLOSURE AS PART OF YOUR RESPONSE. THE COMPANY DEFINES KEY OPERATIONAL UNIT MEASURES (MAINLINE OPERATING STATISTICS) IN THE FOOTNOTES TO ITS ITEM 6 -SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA TABLE ON PAGE 35 OF ITS 2009 FORM 10-K. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DISCLOSES THE NUMBER OF REVENUE PASSENGERS BOARDED IT USES AVAILABLE SEAT MILES ( ASMS ) AND REVENUE PASSENGER MILES ( RPMS ) AS BETTER COMPARATIVE MEASURES OF AVAILABLE CAPACITY AND PASSENGER VOLUME WHEN EVALUATING ITS REVENUE PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS AND RELATIVE TO EARLIER COMPARABLE PERIODS FOR THE COMPANY. THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY HAS LONG EVALUATED OVERALL PASSENGER REVENUE PERFORMANCE AS A FUNCTION OF PASSENGER REVENUE PER AVAILABLE SEAT MILE ( PRASM ). THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY VARIABLES WHICH EXPLAIN CHANGES IN PRASM: (A) CHANGE IN THE AVERAGE PRICE PAID PER REVENUE PASSENGER MILE (YIELD) AND (B) CHANGE IN THE RATIO OF RPMS TO ASMS (LOAD FACTOR). THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE OPERATIONAL MEASURES PROVIDE THE BEST EXPLANATIONS OF PRICE AND VOLUME CHANGES IMPACTING PASSENGER REVENUE AND ALSO PROVIDE FOR CONSISTENT COMPARISONS OF THESE MEASURES ACROSS THE COMPANY S PEER GROUP. CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS BOARDED AND CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE PRICE PER PASSENGER BOARDED DO NOT FULLY EXPLAIN IMPORTANT UNDERLYING REVENUE TRENDS. FOR EXAMPLE THE COMPANY COULD EXPERIENCE NO CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF ENPLANED PASSENGERS BUT COULD HAVE AN INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM SEAT SALES DUE TO THE SAME NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS PURCHASING TICKETS ON AVERAGE FOR LONGER FLIGHTS. SIMILAR TO THE ISSUE OF UTILIZING ENPLANED PASSENGERS AS A VOLUME MEASURE AVERAGE TICKET PRICE DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHETHER REVENUE INCREASED BECAUSE CUSTOMERS PURCHASED A HIGHER PROPORTION OF TICKETS FOR LONGER FLIGHTS. AVERAGE PRICE PER TICKET IS NOT A MEASURE COMMONLY USED BY GLOBAL AIR CARRIERS SO IT USUALLY CANNOT BE USED TO MAKE REVENUE PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS TO THE COMPANY S PEER GROUP. FOR THESE REASONS THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE MEASURES CURRENTLY UTILIZED TO DESCRIBE ITS REVENUE FLUCTUATIONS IN ITS 2009 FORM 10-K ARE ADEQUATE AND DISCLOSURE OF THE SUGGESTED ADDITIONAL MEASURES IS NOT NECESSARY. 9 _______________________________________________________________________ IN FUTURE FORM 10-Q AND 10-K FILINGS THE COMPANY WILL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE AS AN INTRODUCTION TO ITS MD A DISCUSSION OF REVENUE VARIANCES TO FURTHER CLARIFY THE MEASURES USED: THE DISCUSSION BELOW UTILIZES CERTAIN STATISTICAL AND UNIT MEASURES THE COMPANY BELIEVES ARE USEFUL FOR EVALUATION OF ITS PASSENGER REVENUE PERFORMANCE ON A PRICE-VOLUME BASIS. THE KEY VOLUME METRICS UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY ARE AVAILABLE SEAT MILES WHICH IS THE NUMBER OF SEATS AVAILABLE FOR PASSENGERS MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF MILES THOSE SEATS ARE FLOWN REVENUE PASSENGER MILES WHICH IS THE NUMBER OF SCHEDULED MILES FLOWN BY REVENUE PASSENGERS AND LOAD FACTOR WHICH IS RPMS DIVIDED BY ASMS. THE KEY PRICE MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY ARE PASSENGER REVENUE PER ASM (PRASM) AND PASSENGER REVENUE PER RPM (YIELD). OPERATING EXPENSES PAGE 45 24. WE NOTE THAT DURING FISCAL YEAR 2009 YOU RECOGNIZED SIGNIFICANT NON-CASH FUEL HEDGE GAINS WHILE ALSO RECOGNIZING MATERIAL CASH FUEL HEDGE LOSSES. SIMILARLY NON-CASH FUEL HEDGES HAD A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT IMPACT ON YOUR FISCAL YEAR 2008 OPERATING RESULTS THAN CASH FUEL HEDGES. GIVEN THE OBSERVATIONS NOTED ABOVE WE BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD EXPAND YOUR MD A DISCLOSURE TO SEPARATELY DISCUSS THE FACTORS DIRECTLY IMPACTING THE GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED FOR NON-CASH FUEL HEDGE ACTIVITY VERSUS CASH FUEL HEDGE ACTIVITY. PLEASE REVISE YOUR DISCLOSURE ACCORDINGLY OR ADVISE. IN ADDITION PLEASE PROVIDE YOUR PROPOSED EXPANDED DISCLOSURE AS PART OF YOUR RESPONSE. THE COMPANY S DISCUSSION OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SEPARATELY EXPLAINS CASH AND NON-CASH FUEL HEDGE IMPACTS. A CASH HEDGE GAIN/LOSS INCLUDES ACTUAL CASH PAID OR RECEIVED UPON SETTLEMENT OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS PLUS OR MINUS THE INITIAL AMOUNT PAID OR RECEIVED FOR THE DERIVATIVE IF ANY. A NON-CASH HEDGE GAIN/LOSS REPRESENTS UNREALIZED MARK-TO-MARKET ( MTM ) GAIN/LOSS RECORDED DURING A PERIOD AND IN THE PERIOD OF SETTLEMENT THE REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY RECORDED MTM GAIN/LOSS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS INFORMATION IS TO ALLOW INVESTORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY S FUEL COST IN EACH PERIOD THAT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO FUEL DERIVATIVE CASH SETTLEMENT IMPACTS AS WELL AS THE PERIODIC IMPACT OF MARKING TO MARKET THOSE FUEL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WHICH HAVE NOT YET SETTLED. THE COMPANY HAS CONSISTENTLY PRESENTED ITS FUEL HEDGE GAINS AND LOSSES IN THIS MANNER SINCE 2008 WHEN EXTREME FUEL PRICE VOLATILITY RESULTED IN MATERIAL UNREALIZED MTM LOSSES. THE COMPANY INCLUDED SEVERAL DISCLOSURES REGARDING THE IMPACT OF CASH AND NON-CASH FUEL HEDGE GAIN/LOSS IN ITS 2009 10-K. PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING DETAILED DISCLOSURE THAT WAS INCLUDED UNDER BUSINESS ON PAGE 6 OF THE 2009 10-K: FUEL. THE PRICE AND AVAILABILITY OF JET FUEL SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS THE COMPANY S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FUEL HAS BEEN ONE OF THE COMPANY S LARGEST OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE COMPANY HAS A RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY TO HEDGE A PORTION OF ITS PRICE RISK RELATED TO PROJECTED JET FUEL REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY S HEDGING STRATEGY CURRENTLY UTILIZES PURCHASED CALLS AND SWAPS. IF FUEL PRICES RISE ABOVE THE FIXED SWAP PRICE THE COMPANY S COUNTERPARTIES ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS TO THE COMPANY WHILE IF FUEL PRICES FALL BELOW THE FIXED SWAP PRICE THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO MAKE SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS TO ITS FUEL HEDGE COUNTERPARTIES. IN ADDITION THE COMPANY HAS BEEN AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE COUNTERPARTIES WITH CASH COLLATERAL PRIOR TO SETTLEMENT OF THE HEDGE POSITIONS. FUEL PRICES WERE EXTREMELY VOLATILE DURING THE THREE YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31 2009 AS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW. IN 2009 THE COMPANY BENEFITED FROM A LOWER AVERAGE PURCHASE PRICE AS COMPARED TO THE TWO PRIOR YEARS DUE TO LOWER MARKET PRICES FOR JET FUEL. THE COMPANY S OPERATING RESULTS IN 2008 WERE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THE UNPRECEDENTED INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL TO A PEAK OF APPROXIMATELY 145 PER BARREL IN JULY 2008 FOLLOWED BY A DECREASE OF MORE THAN 100 PER BARREL TO APPROXIMATELY 45 PER BARREL IN DECEMBER 2008. THIS 10 _______________________________________________________________________ VOLATILITY RESULTED IN THE COMPANY REPORTING TOTAL FUEL HEDGE LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY 1.1 BILLION IN 2008. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE LOSSES WAS UNREALIZED AS OF DECEMBER 31 2008 AND THE RELATED CONTRACTS WERE SETTLED IN 2009 AS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW. FUEL PRICES WERE SOMEWHAT LESS VOLATILE IN 2009 AND 2007 AS COMPARED TO 2008 RESULTING IN LESS SIGNIFICANT HEDGE IMPACTS IN THESE YEARS. TOTAL FUEL HEDGE GAINS OF 135 MILLION AND 83 MILLION WERE REPORTED IN 2009 AND 2007 RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BENEFIT FROM LOWER FUEL PRICES ON ITS UNHEDGED FUEL CONSUMPTION AND ITS LIQUIDITY IS SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS BASED ON CASH SETTLEMENTS AND COLLATERAL THAT MAY BE REQUIRED. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR THE MAJORITY OF ITS FUEL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AS ECONOMIC HEDGES WHICH ARE MARKED-TO-MARKET WITH GAINS AND LOSSES CLASSIFIED AS FUEL EXPENSE. REMAINING FUEL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WHICH DO NOT QUALIFY FOR ECONOMIC HEDGE ACCOUNTING ARE MARKED-TO-MARKET WITH GAINS AND LOSSES CLASSIFIED AS NONOPERATING EXPENSE.
