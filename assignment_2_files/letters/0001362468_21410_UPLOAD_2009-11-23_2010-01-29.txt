UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON D.C. 20549 DIVISION OF CORPORATION FINANCE NOVEMBER 23 2009 MR. ANDREW C. LEVY CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER ALLEGIANT TRAVEL COMPANY 8360 S. DURANGO DRIVE LAS VEGAS NV 89113 RE: ALLEGIANT TRAVEL COMPANY FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2008 FILE NO. 000-31683 DEAR MR. LEVY: WE HAVE REVIEWED YOUR CORRESPONDENCE DATED NOVEMBER 10 2009 AND HAVE THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS. UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED WE BELIEVE YOU SHOULD REVISE FUTURE FILINGS IN RESPONSE TO THESE COMMENTS. IF YOU DISAGREE WE WILL CONSIDER YOUR EXPLANATION AS TO WHY A REVISION IS UNNECESSARY. PLEASE BE AS DETAILED AS NECESSARY IN YOUR EXPLANATION. ADDITIONALLY WE ASK YOU TO PROVIDE US WITH FURTHER INFORMATION SO WE MAY BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR DISCLOSURE. AFTER REVIEWING THIS INFORMATION WE MAY RAISE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. PLEASE FILE YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR COMMENTS VIA EDGAR UNDER THE LABEL CORRESP WITHIN TEN BUSINESS DAYS FROM THE DATE OF THIS LETTER. FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2008 SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA PAGE 29 1. YOUR RESPONSE TO PRIOR COMMENT 2 IS UNCLEAR WITH REGARD TO THE PRESENTATION OF ANCILLARY REVENUE PER ASM. PLEASE TELL US THE MEANINGFULNESS OF PROVIDING AVAILABLE SEAT MILES IN RELATION TO ANCILLARY REVENUE (FOR EXAMPLE HOW DOES IT IMPACT REVENUE DERIVED BY HOTEL ROOMS) OR ELIMINATE REVENUES NOT DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE SEAT MILES FROM THE VARIOUS METRICS. ITEM 7. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PAGE 35 2. WE NOTE YOUR RESPONSE TO PRIOR COMMENT 4. WE ARE UNCLEAR AS TO WHY THE SEPARATE PRESENTATION OF REVENUES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS AND UNBUNDLED AIR TRAVEL RELATED CHARGES IS AN ARBITRARY GROUPING AS YOU STATE IN YOUR ALLEGIANT TRAVEL COMPANY NOVEMBER 23 2009 PAGE 2 OF 2 RESPONSE ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT THEY WERE GROUPED THIS WAY FOR YOUR INVESTORS IN YOUR INVESTOR PRESENTATION. WHILE ANCILLARY REVENUE MAY BE IMPACTED BY MULTIPLE FACTORS NOT ALL OF WHICH ARE UNDER YOUR CONTROL WE DO NOT AGREE THAT THIS MEANS QUANTIFYING AND DISCUSSING REVENUES FROM THE THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS AND UNBUNDLED TRAVEL-RELATED CHARGES SUB-CATEGORIES WOULD NOT BE MEANINGFUL TO INVESTORS. TO THE CONTRARY GIVEN THE RAPIDLY GROWING SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE AMOUNTS TO YOUR REPORTED RESULTS IT APPEARS THAT A MORE DETAILED DISCLOSURE WOULD PROVIDE VERY USEFUL INSIGHT INTO YOUR RESULTS TO YOUR INVESTORS WHETHER YOU CAN ATTRIBUTE ALL VARIANCES TO KNOWN FACTORS OR NOT. THEREFORE WE BELIEVE YOU SHOULD REVISE TO SEPARATELY QUANTIFY AND DISCUSS REVENUES FROM THESE TWO ANCILLARY REVENUE SUB-CATEGORIES. 3. WE NOTE YOUR RESPONSE TO PRIOR COMMENT 6 IN WHICH YOU STATE THAT READERS CAN ANALYZE YOUR FIXED FEE CONTRACT REVENUE BY EXAMINING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE STATISTICS PROVIDED FOR TOTAL SYSTEM OPERATIONS AND SCHEDULED SERVICE OPERATIONS. WHILE WE AGREE THAT READERS COULD IN FACT PERFORM THESE CALCULATIONS AND ATTEMPT TO DRAW THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS FROM THE RESULTING DATA WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTENT OF MD A DISCLOSURE IS TO PROVIDE A DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THROUGH THE EYES OF MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION WE BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING A DIRECT ANALYSIS OF FIXED FEE CONTRACT REVENUE WILL PROVIDE A MORE USER FRIENDLY PRESENTATION OF YOUR RESULTS TO YOUR INVESTORS. THEREFORE WE REISSUE OUR PRIOR COMMENT AND REQUEST THAT YOU REVISE YOUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION THAT WILL PROVIDE CONTEXT FOR THE RESULTS OF YOUR FIXED FEE CONTRACT BUSINESS. PLEASE CONTACT THERESA MESSINESE AT 202-551-3307 OR THE UNDERSIGNED AT 202-551-3380 WITH ANY QUESTIONS. SINCERELY LYN SHENK BRANCH CHIEF CC: ROBERT B. GOLDBERG COUNSEL
