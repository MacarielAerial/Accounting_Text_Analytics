FORM 8-K FURNISHED APRIL 17 2017 EXHIBIT 99.1 RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) PAGE 8 3. WE NOTE YOU USE NON-GAAP AMOUNTS IN THE COMPUTATION OF YOUR MEASURE OF ROIC. ALTHOUGH YOU CHARACTERIZE IN YOUR NARRATIVE THE MEASURE AS NON-GAAP PLEASE CONSIDER LABELING THE MEASURE AS NON-GAAP TO PREVENT CONFUSION WITH COMPUTATIONS OF ROIC BASED SOLELY ON GAAP AMOUNTS. RESPONSE: THE COMPANY WILL COMPLY WITH THE STAFF S REQUEST TO LABEL ROIC AS NON-GAAP IN FUTURE FILINGS. 4. IN REGARD TO YOUR COMPUTATION OF ROIC FOR TRANSPARENCY TO INVESTORS PLEASE CONSIDER PRESENTING AND QUANTIFYING THE COMPONENTS MAKING UP EACH OF SPECIAL ITEMS AND ADJUSTMENTS.

PURSUANT TO RULE 83 (17 C.F.R. 200.83) 5. IN REGARD TO YOUR NOPAT ADJUSTMENTS PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US AND DISCLOSE WHAT NET OF TAX SHIELD REPRESENTS. RESPONSE: THE COMPANY USED THE TERM TAX SHIELD TO MEAN THE TAX BENEFIT (MEASURED BASED ON CASH TAXES PAID AS A PERCENTAGE OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS) FROM EACH OF THE ADJUSTMENTS (INTEREST EXPENSE IMPUTED INTEREST ON AIRCRAFT LEASES AND INTEREST COMPONENT OF PENSION COSTS). THE COMPANY WILL ENHANCE ITS DESCRIPTION OF TAX SHIELD IN FUTURE FILINGS. 6. IN NOTE (D) TO THE ROIC COMPUTATION YOU STATE CAPITAL AIRCRAFT RENT IS ADDED BACK AT 7.0X. PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US AND DISCLOSE WHAT 7.0X REPRESENTS AND THE BASIS FOR THIS ADJUSTMENT. RESPONSE: THE COMPANY USES A SIMPLIFIED METHOD USED BY MANY RATING AGENCIES AND FINANCIAL ANALYSTS TO ASSIST WITH THE IMPACT OF OPERATING LEASES ON FINANCIAL MEASURES LIKE RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. THE COMPANY USES A MULTIPLE 7 TIMES ITS ANNUAL AIRCRAFT RENT EXPENSE TO ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL CAPITALIZED VALUE AND RELATED LIABILITY OF ITS AIRCRAFT. THE COMPANY HAS DISCLOSED IN ITS 2016 FORM 10-K THAT ITS AIRCRAFT LEASES HAVE EXPIRATION DATES RANGING FROM 2017 TO 2028. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE 7.0X MULTIPLE OF AIRCRAFT RENT EXPENSE IS REASONABLE. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL RECONCILIATION PAGE 9 7. IT APPEARS THE TERMS SPECIAL ITEMS AND SPECIAL CHARGES ARE INTENDED TO BY SYNONYMOUS. FOR CLARITY TO INVESTORS THAT EACH TERM IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF SEPARATE AND DIFFERENT ITEMS AND AMOUNTS PLEASE USE ONE TERM OR THE OTHER. RESPONSE: THE COMPANY HAS INTENTIONALLY USED THE DIFFERENT TERMS. PAGE 14 OF THE FORM 8-K CONTAINS A RECAP OF BOTH SPECIAL CHARGES AND SPECIAL ITEMS. AS NOTED ON THAT PAGE SPECIAL CHARGES ARE ALL OF THE UNUSUAL AND NON-RECURRING ITEMS HIGHLIGHTED FROM OUR OPERATING AND NON-OPERATING EXPENSES. SPECIAL ITEMS INCLUDE THE TOTAL OF ALL SPECIAL CHARGES INCOME TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIAL CHARGES AND ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO PRIOR PERIOD GAINS AND LOSSES ON FUEL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS SETTLING IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. 8. IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH ON PAGE 9 YOU STATE YOU EXCLUDE THIRD-PARTY BUSINESS EXPENSES SUCH AS MAINTENANCE GROUND HANDLING AND CATERING SERVICES FOR THIRD PARTIES AND FUEL EXPENSE IN REPORTING CASM BECAUSE THESE EXPENSES ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO YOUR CORE BUSINESS. HOWEVER IT APPEARS THESE ARE NORMAL RECURRING OPERATING EXPENSES NECESSARY TO OPERATE YOUR BUSINESS. PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US AND DISCLOSE WHAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE YOUR CORE BUSINESS AND WHY THESE EXPENSES ARE NOT RELATED TO THIS. ALSO EXPLAIN TO US HOW YOUR TREATMENT COMPLIES WITH QUESTION 100.01 OF STAFF S COMPLIANCE AND DISCLOSURE INTERPRETATIONS ON NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ( THE C DI ). RESPONSE: THE COMPANY HAS DIFFERENT REASONS FOR EXCLUDING FUEL EXPENSE AND THIRD-PARTY BUSINESS EXPENSES. THE COMPANY DISCLOSED EXCLUDING FUEL COSTS FROM CERTAIN MEASURES IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS NOT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT CORE TO THE BUSINESS BUT RATHER BECAUSE IT PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE OF MANAGEMENT S PERFORMANCE EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF A SIGNIFICANT COST ITEM OVER WHICH MANAGEMENT HAS LIMITED INFLUENCE. WITH RESPECT TO THIRD-PARTY BUSINESS EXPENSES THE DISCLOSURE STATED THAT WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING THIRD-PARTY BUSINESS EXPENSES SUCH AS MAINTENANCE GROUND HANDLING AND CATERING SERVICES FOR THIRD-PARTIES FUEL SALES [EMPHASIS ADDED] AND NON-AIR MILEAGE REDEMPTIONS PROVIDES MORE MEANINGFUL 6 _______________________________________________________________________ LOGO FOIA CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUEST BY UNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS INC. PURSUANT TO RULE 83 (17 C.F.R. 200.83) DISCLOSURE BECAUSE THESE EXPENSES ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO UAL S CORE BUSINESS. THE FUEL ITEM REFERRED TO IN THIS STATEMENT IS THE COST OF FUEL THAT WE SELL TO OTHERS NOT THE COST OF FUEL USED IN OUR OPERATIONS. PERFORMING SERVICES FOR OTHER COMPANIES IS DIFFERENT THAN OUR CORE BUSINESS AS WE DO NOT NEED TO PERFORM THESE SERVICES TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS OF TRANSPORTING PASSENGERS AND CARGO. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE SERVICES WOULD LIKELY NOT BE INCURRED WERE IT NOT FOR THE SERVICE BEING PERFORMED. AS NONE OF THESE EXPENSES REPRESENT NORMAL RECURRING CASH OPERATING EXPENSES NECESSARY TO OPERATE THE REGISTRANT S BUSINESS THE COMPANY BELIEVES SUCH DISCLOSURES ARE NOT MISLEADING. 9. YOU EXCLUDE AIRCRAFT RENT FROM YOUR COMPUTATION OF EBITDAR. AIRCRAFT RENT APPEARS TO BE A NORMAL RECURRING CASH OPERATING EXPENSE NECESSARY TO OPERATE YOUR BUSINESS. ACCORDINGLY THIS EXCLUSION DOES NOT APPEAR TO COMPLY WITH THE ABOVE NOTED C DI. PLEASE REVISE YOUR COMPUTATION ACCORDINGLY. RESPONSE: THE COMPANY INCLUDED EBITDAR AS A NON-GAAP DISCLOSURE AS A USEFUL TOOL TO INVESTORS. SOME AIRLINES UTILIZE OPERATING LEASES EXTENSIVELY AND SOME DO VERY LITTLE AIRCRAFT LEASING. BY EXCLUDING AIRCRAFT RENT EBITDAR PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE OF COMPARISON IN THE INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY WILL COMPLY WITH THE STAFF S REQUEST AND REMOVE EBITDAR FROM FUTURE FILINGS. WITH RESPECT TO THE PRECEDING RESPONSES THE COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGES THE FOLLOWING: O THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADEQUACY AND ACCURACY OF THE DISCLOSURE IN THE FILING O STAFF COMMENTS OR CHANGES TO DISCLOSURE IN RESPONSE TO STAFF COMMENTS DO NOT FORECLOSE THE COMMISSION FROM TAKING ANY ACTION WITH RESPECT TO THE FILING AND O THE COMPANY MAY NOT ASSERT STAFF COMMENTS AS A DEFENSE IN ANY PROCEEDING INITIATED BY THE COMMISSION OR ANY PERSON UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. SHOULD THE STAFF HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AFTER REVIEWING THIS LETTER THE COMPANY WOULD APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE COMMENTS WITH THE STAFF. PLEASE DIRECT ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS LETTER TO ME AT (872) 825-3077.
