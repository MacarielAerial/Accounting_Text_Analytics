ASC 230-10-50-3 REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ABOUT ALL INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF AN ENTITY DURING A PERIOD THAT AFFECT RECOGNIZED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES BUT THAT DO NOT RESULT IN CASH RECEIPTS OR CASH PAYMENTS IN THE PERIOD. OUR NON-CASH INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEARS BETWEEN 2016 AND 2018 WERE INSIGNIFICANT AND REPRESENTED LESS THAN 1 OF TOTAL CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN EACH OF THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS. WE DID NOT INCUR ANY NON-CASH FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING 2018 AND 2017. DURING 2016 HOLDERS OF OUR 6.75 CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES DUE 2039 (SERIES B) VOLUNTARILY CONVERTED APPROXIMATELY 86 MILLION IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT INTO SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. AS A RESULT WE ISSUED 17.6 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THIS INFORMATION WAS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 7 -EARNINGS PER SHARE. IN FUTURE FILINGS WE WILL INCLUDE THE DISCLOSURE ANY SIGNIFICANT NON-CASH INVESTING OR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 -REVENUE RECOGNITION PAGE 64 2. WE NOTE FROM PAGE 7 THAT YOU HAVE INTERLINE AND CODE-SHARING AGREEMENTS WITH 49 AIRLINES. TO THE EXTENT REVENUE RECOGNIZED FROM SUCH ARRANGEMENTS IS MATERIAL PLEASE PROVIDE US WITH YOUR ANALYSIS REGARDING HOW YOU RECOGNIZE SUCH REVENUE. YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD INCLUDE WHETHER YOU ARE THE PRINCIPAL OR AGENT FOR THESE SERVICES AND HOW YOU MADE SUCH DETERMINATION. REFERENCE TO ASC606-10-55-36 THROUGH 39. COMPANY RESPONSE: WHILE JETBLUE DOES PARTICIPATE IN INTERLINE AND CODE-SHARING AGREEMENTS WITH 49 AIRLINES THE REVENUES GENERATED FROM THOSE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT MATERIAL REPRESENTING LESS THAN 3 OF OUR CONSOLIDATED OPERATING REVENUES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS CONTINUE TO FLY POINT TO POINT AND OF THOSE THAT DO CONNECT TO ANOTHER FLIGHT ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE CONNECT WITH ANOTHER AIRLINE. REVENUE GENERATED FROM INTERLINE AND CODE-SHARING AGREEMENTS ARE COMPRISED OF TICKETS SOLD ON BEHALF OF JETBLUE BY OTHER AIRLINES OR BY JETBLUE ON BEHALF OF OTHER AIRLINES. WITH BOTH OF THESE TICKETING ARRANGEMENTS WE BELIEVE THAT EACH FLIGHT SEGMENT ON THE TICKET CREATES A SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION OF THE CONTRACT. WHEN APPLYING THE GUIDANCE IN PARAGRAPHS 606-10-55-37 AND 37A WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE OPERATING CARRIER FOR EACH FLIGHT SEGMENT IS THE PRINCIPAL AS THE OPERATING CARRIER CONTROLS THE SERVICES BEFORE BEING TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER. TICKETS SOLD BY OTHER AIRLINES WHERE JETBLUE OPERATES A SEGMENT OF THE TICKET ARE RECOGNIZED AS PASSENGER REVENUE AT THE ESTIMATED VALUE TO BE BILLED TO THE OTHER AIRLINE WHEN TRAVEL IS PROVIDED. FOR SEGMENTS OPERATED BY OTHER AIRLINE PARTNERS ON TICKETS SOLD BY JETBLUE THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT IT IS ACTING AS AN AGENT ON BEHALF OF THE OTHER AIRLINES AS THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR PORTION OF THE CONTRACT. JETBLUE AS THE AGENT RECOGNIZES REVENUE AFTER THE TRAVEL HAS OCCURRED FOR THE NET AMOUNT WHICH REPRESENTS THE COMMISSION TO BE RETAINED BY JETBLUE FOR ANY SEGMENTS FLOWN BY OTHER AIRLINES. __________________________________________________________________ THE COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADEQUACY AND ACCURACY OF THE DISCLOSURE IN THE ABOVE-REFERENCED FILING. WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. PLEASE CONTACT THE UNDERSIGNED AT (718) 709-3104 WITH ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YOU MAY HAVE.
