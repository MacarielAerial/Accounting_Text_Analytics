SEGMENT INFORMATION 5. REFERENCE IS MADE TO NOTE 1 (FRONTIER JETEXPRESS) AND NOTE 12 (SUBSEQUENT EVENT). IN VIEW OF THE JANUARY 2007 AGREEMENT WITH REPUBLIC AIRLINES ( REPUBLIC ) TO OPERATE UNDER THE FRONTIER JETEXPRESS BRAND WITH 17 AIRCRAFT THAT MR. JEFFERY S. POTTER FRONTIER AIRLINES FEBRUARY 13 2007 PAGE 4 REPLACES THE NINE AIRCRAFT PREVIOUSLY OPERATED UNDER AGREEMENT WITH HORIZON IT APPEARS THE IMPACT ON YOUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL BE MATERIAL AS YOU HAVE ALMOST DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT THAT WILL BE OPERATED BY OTHER AIRLINES. IT IS UNCLEAR AS TO YOUR CONSIDERATION ON INCLUDING SEPARATE SEGMENT REPORTING INFORMATION IN YOUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THIS NEW ARRANGEMENT WITH REPUBLIC. FROM INFORMATION HEREIN AND DISCLOSURES IN YOUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS FOR SEPARATELY REPORTING REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF REGIONAL PARTNERS IT APPEARS THAT THIS IS A SEPARATE OPERATING SEGMENT UNDER THE GUIDANCE IN SFAS NO. 131. WITH RESPECT TO AGGREGATING OPERATING SEGMENTS A COMPANY MUST MEET ALL AGGREGATION CRITERIA INCLUDING SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AS LISTED IN PARAGRAPH 17 OF SFAS NO. 131. WE BELIEVE THAT AGGREGATION IS A HIGH HURDLE AND IS APPROPRIATE ONLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE AS STATED IN THE BASIS OF CONCLUSIONS TO SFAS 131 SEPARATE REPORTING OF SEGMENT INFORMATION WILL NOT ADD SIGNIFICANTLY TO AN INVESTOR S UNDERSTANDING OF AN ENTERPRISE (BECAUSE) ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS HAVE CHARACTERISTICS SO SIMILAR THAT THEY CAN BE EXPECTED TO HAVE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME FUTURE PROSPECTS. IN THIS REGARD THIS AGREEMENT WITH REPUBLIC APPEARS TO PROVIDE DIFFERENT ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS FROM YOUR OWN MAINLINE AIRLINE OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS THIS ARRANGEMENT IS SUBJECT TO FINANCIAL INCENTIVES PENALTIES AND CHANGES TO MARGIN DISTINCT TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OPERATOR (I.E. REGIONAL PARTNER). FURTHERMORE WE NOTE THAT THE OPERATING MARGINS FROM YOUR PRIOR HISTORICAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH REGIONAL PARTNERS (I.E. PASSENGER REVENUES LESS OPERATING EXPENSES OF REGIONAL PARTNERS) APPEARS TO HAVE PROVIDED SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS THAN OPERATING MARGINS INCURRED BY YOUR OWN MAINLINE OPERATED AIRCRAFT RELATIVE TO THE PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES GENERATED BY EACH OF THESE SEPARATE OPERATING ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION THE PRESENTATION OF SELECTED MAINLINE OPERATING STATISTICS THAT EXCLUDE REGIONAL PARTNERS FINANCIAL DATA AS WELL AS SEPARATE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DISCUSSION FOR MAINLINE OPERATIONS AND REGIONAL PARTNERS IN THE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA (PAGE 29) AND MD A (PAGE 35) IN THE FORM 10-K APPEARS TO IMPLY THAT THESE SEPARATE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES HAVE DISSIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS. THEREFORE IT APPEARS THAT SEPARATE REPORTABLE SEGMENT INFORMATION FOR THIS ARRANGEMENT WITH YOUR REGIONAL PARTNER MAY BE REQUIRED UNDER THE MR. JEFFERY S. POTTER FRONTIER AIRLINES FEBRUARY 13 2007 PAGE 5 GUIDANCE IN SFAS NO. 131 AS WELL AS PARAGRAPH 2.61 OF THE AICPA INDUSTRY AUDIT GUIDE FOR AIRLINES.
