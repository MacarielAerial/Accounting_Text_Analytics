COMPANY RESPONSE TO COMMENT 1: IN OUR EARNINGS RELEASE WE PROVIDED PROJECTED ADJUSTED EBITDA BUT WE DID NOT PROVIDE A RECONCILIATION TO A PROJECTED COMPARABLE U.S. GAAP MEASURE BECAUSE WE DO NOT KNOW THE SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTING VALUES AND DEVELOPING THE VALUES WOULD REQUIRE US TO PREDICT 1 __________________________________________________________________ CERTAIN PERTINENT INFORMATION WHICH WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH REASONABLE ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. THE LARGEST ADJUSTMENTS INVOLVE THE PERIOD-END FAIR VALUE RE-MEASUREMENT OF STOCK WARRANTS GRANTED TO A CUSTOMER AS INCENTIVES. THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RE-MEASUREMENTS INVOLVE SEVERAL ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS THE PRICE OF ATSG STOCK WHICH ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. AS A RESULT A RECONCILIATION OF THE PROJECTED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE GUIDANCE TO THE CORRESPONDING PROJECTED GAAP MEASURE IS NOT AVAILABLE WITHOUT UNREASONABLE EFFORTS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH QUESTION 102.10 IN THE STAFF S COMPLIANCE AND DISCLOSURE INTERPRETATIONS AND WITH CONSIDERATION TO ITEM 10(E)(1)(I)(B) OF REGULATION S-K WE WILL REVISE OUR NON-GAAP DISCLOSURES TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE ADJUSTMENTS BEGINNING WITH THE COMPANY S NEXT EARNINGS RELEASE AND IN ALL SUBSEQUENT PUBLIC DISCLOSURES OF PROJECTED ADJUSTED EBITDA. OUR EARNINGS RELEASE WILL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURES: THE HISTORICAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES INCLUDED IN THIS RELEASE ARE RECONCILED TO GAAP EARNINGS IN TABLES INCLUDED LATER IN THIS RELEASE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT PROVIDE A RECONCILIATION OF PROJECTED ADJUSTED EBITDA BECAUSE IT IS UNABLE TO PREDICT WITH REASONABLE ACCURACY THE VALUE OF CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE PERIOD-END RE-MEASUREMENTS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDING STOCK WARRANTS ISSUED TO CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY S EARNINGS ON A GAAP BASIS AND THE NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS FOR GAIN AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF STOCK WARRANTS WILL DEPEND ON THE FUTURE PRICES OF ATSG STOCK INTEREST RATES AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS WHICH ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN.
