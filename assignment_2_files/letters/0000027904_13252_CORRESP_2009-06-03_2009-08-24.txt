DELTA AIR LINES INC. DEPARTMENT 828 P.O. BOX 20706 ATLANTA GA 30320-6001 JUNE 3 2009 MS. LINDA CVRKEL BRANCH CHIEF DIVISION OF CORPORATION FINANCE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION 100 F STREET N.E. MAIL STOP 3561 WASHINGTON D.C. 20549 RE: DELTA AIR LINES INC. ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2008 FILED MARCH 2 2009 FILE NO. 001-05424 DEAR MS. CVRKEL: THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO THE STAFF S LETTER DATED MAY 7 2009 REGARDING DELTA S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2008. FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE WE HAVE INCLUDED IN THIS LETTER EACH OF THE STAFF S COMMENTS BEFORE PROVIDING OUR RESPONSE TO THAT COMMENT. FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2008 STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS PAGE F-5 1. WE NOTE THAT YOUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCLUDES A LINE TITLED OTHER NET. IN LIGHT OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS AMOUNT TO THE TOTAL NET CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN EACH PERIOD FOR WHICH A CASH FLOW STATEMENT IS PRESENTED PLEASE REVISE FUTURE FILINGS TO PROVIDE FURTHER DETAIL OF THE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS INCLUDED IN THIS AMOUNT. RESPONSE: WE WILL INCLUDE IN FUTURE FILINGS AS APPLICABLE DETAIL ABOUT SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF OTHER NET CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. SPECIFICALLY WE WILL REPORT SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS AS A SEPARATE LINE ITEM IN THE STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOW OR INCLUDE APPROPRIATE DISCLOSURE IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. -1- _________________________________________________________________ NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTE 1. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICES PAGE F-7 GENERAL 2. WE NOTE THAT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF YOUR CURRENT ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31 2008 AND 2007. PLEASE REVISE FUTURE FILINGS TO INCLUDE A NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHICH INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODOLOGY USED TO ESTIMATE THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS THE POLICY FOR CHARGING OFF UNCOLLECTIBLE LOANS AND TRADE RECEIVABLES AND THE POLICY FOR DETERMINING PAST DUE OR DELINQUENCY STATUS (I.E. WHETHER PAST DUE STATUS IS BASED ON HOW RECENTLY PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED OR CONTRACTUAL TERMS). SEE PARAGRAPH 13A-C OF SOP 01-6. RESPONSE: PLEASE NOTE THAT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE GENERATED LARGELY FROM THE SALE OF PASSENGER AIRLINE TICKETS AND CARGO TRANSPORTATION SERVICES. THE MAJORITY OF THESE SALES ARE PROCESSED THROUGH MAJOR CREDIT CARD COMPANIES WHICH TYPICALLY PAY US WITHIN ONE WEEK OF THE SALE. HISTORICALLY CHARGES FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN LESS THAN 0.1 OF TOTAL REVENUES AND WRITE-OFFS HAVE BEEN LESS THAN 2 OF TOTAL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. WE WILL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURE IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FUTURE FILINGS AS APPLICABLE: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PRIMARILY CONSIST OF AMOUNTS DUE FROM CREDIT CARD COMPANIES CUSTOMERS OF OUR AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE AND CARGO TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND OTHER AIRLINES ASSOCIATED WITH FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAMS. WE PROVIDE AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS EQUAL TO THE ESTIMATED LOSSES EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED BASED ON HISTORICAL CHARGEBACKS WRITE-OFFS BANKRUPTCIES AND OTHER SPECIFIC ANALYSES. BAD DEBT EXPENSE AND WRITE-OFFS FOR 2008 2007 AND 2006 WERE IMMATERIAL. NOTE 2. NORTHWEST MERGER PAGE F-18 3. WE NOTE THAT YOU RECORDED SEVERAL INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AS A RESULT OF THE NORTHWEST MERGER. PLEASE PROVIDE US DETAILS OF HOW YOU DETERMINED THE AMOUNT ALLOCATED TO EACH OF THESE INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND WHY YOU BELIEVE IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO ASSIGN AN INDEFINITE LIFE. YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD INCLUDE ALL SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED. RESPONSE: THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS RECORDED AS A RESULT OF THE NORTHWEST MERGER CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PACIFIC INTERNATIONAL ROUTES INTERNATIONAL SLOTS AT THE TOKYO-NARITA AIRPORT THE SKYTEAM ALLIANCE CONSISTING OF THE NORTHWEST-KLM ALLIANCE AND DOMESTIC SLOTS AT RONALD REAGAN WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT AND NEW YORK S LAGUARDIA AIRPORT: INTERNATIONAL ROUTES AND SLOTS PACIFIC ROUTES (DECEMBER 31 2008 BALANCE 1 730 MILLION) NORTHWEST S PACIFIC ROUTE AUTHORITIES ARE UNIQUE AND VALUABLE LEGAL RIGHTS WHICH ARE BASED ON THE UNITED STATES-JAPAN BILATERAL AVIATION AGREEMENT. UNDER THIS AGREEMENT NORTHWEST HAS THE RIGHT TO OPERATE UNLIMITED FREQUENCIES BETWEEN ANY POINT IN THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN AS WELL AS EXTENSIVE FIFTH FREEDOM RIGHTS. FIFTH FREEDOM RIGHTS ALLOW NORTHWEST TO OPERATE SERVICE FROM ANY GATEWAY IN JAPAN TO POINTS BEYOND JAPAN AND TO CARRY JAPANESE ORIGINATING PASSENGERS ON THOSE FLIGHTS. NORTHWEST AND UNITED AIRLINES ARE THE ONLY UNITED STATES PASSENGER CARRIERS THAT HAVE FIFTH FREEDOM RIGHTS FROM JAPAN. NORTHWEST S USAGE OF ITS PACIFIC ROUTES IS CONTINGENT UPON ITS TOKYO-NARITA AIRPORT SLOT HOLDINGS. AS DISCUSSED BELOW SLOTS AT TOKYO-NARITA AIRPORT ARE STRICTLY LIMITED AND THIS IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY FACTORS THAT LIMITS THE GROWTH OF AIR SERVICE AT THAT AIRPORT. -2- _________________________________________________________________ WE ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PACIFIC ROUTES USING AN INCOME APPROACH. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY THE FAIR VALUE IS THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXCESS EARNINGS GENERATED BY THE OPERATIONS OF THE PACIFIC ROUTES. WE USED HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED REVENUES COSTS AND OPERATING STATISTICS TO CALCULATE EBITDAR (EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST TAXES DEPRECIATION AMORTIZATION AND RENT). WE THEN SUBTRACTED INCOME TAXES AND CONTRIBUTORY ASSET CHARGES I.E. THE EXPECTED RETURNS ON TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS (SUCH AS FLIGHT EQUIPMENT) WHICH ARE EMPLOYED IN GENERATING THE INCOME ON THE PACIFIC ROUTES. WE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS THROUGH 2012 AND DETERMINED A TERMINAL VALUE ASSUMING EXCESS EARNINGS WOULD GROW AT A RATE OF 3 PER YEAR THEREAFTER. WE CONSIDERED THE FACTORS IN PARAGRAPH 11 OF SFAS 142 AS WELL AS THE IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE CONTAINED IN SFAS 142 APPENDIX A EXAMPLE 6 IN CONCLUDING THAT THE PACIFIC ROUTES HAVE AN INDEFINITE LIFE. NORTHWEST HAS OPERATED THE RESTRICTED JAPAN ROUTES SINCE 1952. DELTA EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO USE THE PACIFIC ROUTE AUTHORITIES INDEFINITELY AND BELIEVES THE RELATED SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE (FACILITY LEASES AND SLOTS) WILL REMAIN IN PLACE AS LONG AS IT HAS THE ROUTE AUTHORITIES. THE PACIFIC ROUTE AUTHORITIES ARE GRANTED FOR A FINITE TERM BUT ARE REGULARLY RENEWED AT MINIMAL COST. BASED ON THESE FACTORS WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE ECONOMIC BENEFITS INDEFINITELY FROM THE PACIFIC ROUTES. INTERNATIONAL ROUTES AND SLOTS NARITA AIRPORT SLOTS (DECEMBER 31 2008 BALANCE 410 MILLION) NORTHWEST HOLDS APPROXIMATELY 400 SLOTS AT THE TOKYO-NARITA AIRPORT ( NRT ). SLOTS ARE RIGHTS GRANTED BY AN AIRPORT OR GOVERNMENT WHICH ALLOW AIRLINES TO SCHEDULE A LANDING OR DEPARTURE AT A SPECIFIC TIME. MANY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTS HAVE SLOT RESTRICTIONS BASED ON CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS AND OTHER FACTORS. WHILE IT IS EASY AND VIRTUALLY COST FREE TO OBTAIN A DESIRABLE SLOT AT SOME AIRPORTS NRT IS CAPACITY-CONSTRAINED WHICH LIMITS THE NUMBER OF DESIRABLE SLOTS. BASED ON THESE FACTORS THE NRT SLOTS ARE AN INTANGIBLE ASSET. WE ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NRT SLOTS BASED ON TRANSACTIONAL SLOT DATA ADJUSTED FOR DIFFERENCES IN THE VALUE AND MARKETABILITY OF THE TWO DIFFERENT NRT RUNWAYS TO WHICH WE HAVE ACCESS. THE CASH FLOWS UTILIZED TO VALUE THE PACIFIC ROUTES AS DISCUSSED ABOVE ARE PROPERLY EXCLUDED IN THE VALUATION OF THE NRT SLOTS. THE AICPA AUDIT ACCOUNTING GUIDELINE FOR AIRLINES STATES IN PARAGRAPH 6.18 THAT IN JAPAN AND CHINA SLOTS ARE SEPARABLE ASSETS BUT CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED APART FROM THE ROUTE AUTHORITY.... SLOTS DO NOT REQUIRE RENEWAL ALTHOUGH THEY ARE SUBJECT TO A USE OR LOSE TEST AND THE AIRLINES HAVE LEGAL TITLE TO THE SLOTS. NORTHWEST HAS MET THE USE OR LOSE REQUIREMENTS AND INCREASED ITS NRT SLOT HOLDINGS FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS. DELTA EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO USE THE PACIFIC ROUTE AUTHORITIES AND THE RELATED NRT SLOTS INDEFINITELY. FOR THESE REASONS WE DESIGNATED THE NRT SLOTS AS INDEFINITE-LIVED. SKYTEAM ALLIANCE (DECEMBER 31 2008 BALANCE 380 MILLION) THE NORTHWEST-KLM ALLIANCE PROVIDES BOTH AIRLINES COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES AND COST SAVINGS UNDER WHICH NORTHWEST AND KLM JOINTLY OPERATE TRANSATLANTIC FLIGHTS. THE ALLIANCE GREATLY EXPANDS THE NETWORKS OF BOTH AIRLINES AND HAS ANTITRUST IMMUNITY. ANTITRUST IMMUNITY ALLOWS FOR COORDINATED PRICING SCHEDULING PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING. THE ALLIANCE PROVIDES NORTHWEST ACCESS TO EUROPEAN DESTINATIONS WITH FLIGHTS HANDLED BY KLM AND PROVIDES KLM ACCESS TO THE UNITED STATES WITH FLIGHTS OPERATED BY NORTHWEST. WE ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NORTHWEST-KLM ALLIANCE USING AN INCOME APPROACH. WE ANALYZED THE EXCESS EBITDAR MARGIN GENERATED BY THE ALLIANCE COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE TRANSATLANTIC EBITDAR MARGINS FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION REGULATORY REPORTS FILED BY OTHER AIRLINES INCLUDING UNITED AMERICAN US AIRWAYS CONTINENTAL AND DELTA DURING 1998 TO 2008. WE ESTIMATED ALLIANCE REVENUE THROUGH 2012 AND ASSUMED REVENUES WILL GROW AT 3 PER YEAR THEREAFTER. WE DISCOUNTED THE EXCESS MARGINS TO REFLECT TIME VALUE OF MONEY AND RISK OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS. -3- _________________________________________________________________ NORTHWEST AND KLM ENTERED INTO THEIR FIRST ALLIANCE AGREEMENT IN 1993. IN 1997 THE AGREEMENT WAS ENHANCED TO INCREASE THE NETWORK COORDINATION BETWEEN THE CARRIERS. THE 1997 AGREEMENT HAD AN INITIAL TERM OF 10 YEARS WITH AUTOMATIC RENEWAL PROVISIONS THEREAFTER. NORTHWEST AND KLM HAVE MADE LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS BASED ON THE EXISTENCE AND CONTINUATION OF THE ALLIANCE AND THE ACCESS IT GIVES TO THE OTHER AIRLINE S HUBS. BOTH CARRIERS RELY ON THE OTHER AIRLINE S IN-COUNTRY SALES FORCE TO MINIMIZE DUPLICATE MARKETING OF TRANSATLANTIC FLIGHTS. DELTA EXPECTS TO CONTINUE RECEIVING THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THIS ALLIANCE INDEFINITELY. IN FACT DELTA RECENTLY ANNOUNCED A NEW ALLIANCE AGREEMENT WITH AIR FRANCE AND KLM WHICH REAFFIRMS THE VALUE OF THE KLM RELATIONSHIP. BASED ON THE CONSIDERATIONS IN PARAGRAPH 11 OF SFAS 142 WE CONCLUDED THAT THERE WERE NO LEGAL CONTRACTUAL COMPETITIVE ECONOMIC OR OTHER FACTORS THAT LIMITED THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE NORTHWEST-KLM ALLIANCE. AS A RESULT WE CONSIDERED THE NORTHWEST-KLM ALLIANCE TO HAVE AN INDEFINITE LIFE. DOMESTIC ROUTES AND SLOTS (DECEMBER 31 2008 BALANCE 110 MILLION) NORTHWEST HOLDS 76 SLOTS AT RONALD REAGAN WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT ( DCA ) AND 48 SLOTS AT NEW YORK S LAGUARDIA AIRPORT ( LGA ). THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION ( FAA ) LIMITS THE NUMBER OF TAKE-OFFS AND LANDINGS ( SLOTS ) AT CERTAIN AIRPORTS TO AVOID EXCESSIVE CONGESTION. CARRIERS DO NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR SLOTS BUT MUST MAINTAIN A MINIMUM LEVEL OF UTILIZATION. AT CONGESTED AIRPORTS INCLUDING DCA AND LGA SLOTS ARE IN HIGH DEMAND. SLOTS ARE SOMETIMES LEASED OR TRADED BETWEEN AIRLINES AND LESS OFTEN PURCHASED OUTRIGHT SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL. TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DCA AND LGA SLOTS WE CALCULATED THE POTENTIAL LEASE SAVINGS ATTRIBUTED TO OWNING THE SLOT RIGHTS AT EACH AIRPORT AS OPPOSED TO LEASING THEM FROM ANOTHER AIRLINE AT MARKET LEASE RATES. WE DERIVED AN ANNUAL LEASE SAVINGS PER SLOT (SEPARATELY FOR DCA AND LGA) MULTIPLIED THIS BY THE NUMBER OF SLOTS NORTHWEST HOLDS AND DISCOUNTED THIS TO PRESENT VALUE. WE REVIEWED PARAGRAPH 11 OF SFAS 142 IN ORDER TO HELP DETERMINE THE LIFE OF THE SLOTS. IN MAKING THIS DETERMINATION WE CONSIDERED THE FOLLOWING FACTS: ONCE SLOTS ARE OBTAINED THEY ARE EASILY RENEWABLE AS LONG AS UTILIZATION MINIMUMS ARE MET. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN ABLE TO RENEW SLOT RIGHTS AT MINIMAL COST. OUR BUSINESS PLAN CONTEMPLATES CONTINUED UTILIZATION OF THE SLOTS. WE BELIEVE CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS AT DCA AND LGA WILL CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE DUE TO AIRPORT RUNWAY AND AIRSPACE CONSTRAINTS. THERE WERE NO LEGAL CONTRACTUAL COMPETITIVE ECONOMIC OR OTHER FACTORS THAT LIMITED THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE SLOTS. SLOTS AT DCA ARE GOVERNED BY THE FAA S HIGH DENSITY RULE WHICH HAS BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE THE 1960S. CONGRESS REPEALED THE HIGH DENSITY RULE AT LGA HOWEVER IT WAS REPLACED BY AN FAA TEMPORARY ORDER AT LGA IN LATE 2006 HAVING SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME EFFECT. THE FAA PROPOSED BUT RECENTLY RESCINDED AN AUCTION RULE TO REALLOCATE SLOTS AT LGA. THE FAA HAS NOW EXTENDED THE TEMPORARY ORDER THROUGH 2010. ALTHOUGH THE LONG-TERM PLAN TO CONTROL CONGESTION AT LGA IS UNKNOWN WE EXPECT THE FAA WILL MAINTAIN AN HOURLY CAPACITY RESTRICTION ON OPERATIONS AND GIVE PREFERENCE TO HISTORIC OPERATING RIGHTS. BASED ON THESE CONSIDERATIONS WE ASSIGNED AN INDEFINITE LIFE TO THE DCA AND LGA SLOTS. A KEY ASSUMPTION USED IN OUR VALUATION OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS DISCUSSED ABOVE IS AN ESTIMATED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL OF 13 AS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 3 OF OUR FORM 10-K (PAGE F-23) AND ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATES RANGING FROM 14 TO 18 DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE ASSET. DURING OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS AND WHEN AN IMPAIRMENT TRIGGER OCCURS WE ASSESS WHETHER ASSET LIVES SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE INDEFINITE. -4- _________________________________________________________________ NOTE. 5. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS PAGE F-29 4. WE NOTE YOUR DISCLOSURE THAT DURING THE MARCH 2008 QUARTER THERE WERE SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN MARKET CAPITALIZATION THAT LED YOU TO PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS OF GOODWILL AND RESULTED IN A 6.9 BILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. IN LIGHT OF THE APPARENT DECLINE IN MARKET CAPITALIZATION DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009 AS WELL AS THE CONTINUING ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS PLEASE TELL US IF YOU PERFORMED ANOTHER IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS ON GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS DURING 2009 AND IF SO PROVIDE US THE RESULTS OF THAT ANALYSIS. IF YOU DID NOT PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS DURING 2009 PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US WHY YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IT WAS NECESSARY. RESPONSE: AS OF MARCH 31 2009 WE PERFORMED AN IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS ON GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. WE REVIEWED BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE FACTORS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 142. AS DISCUSSED BELOW BASED ON THIS ANALYSIS WE CONCLUDED NO IMPAIRMENT OCCURRED DURING THE MARCH 2009 QUARTER. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS DURING OUR QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS WE DID NOT OBSERVE OR NOTE: UNANTICIPATED SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGES IN LEGAL FACTORS ADVERSE ACTIONS OR ASSESSMENTS BY A REGULATOR SIGNIFICANT UNANTICIPATED COMPETITION UNANTICIPATED LOSS OF KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL PLANS TO SELL OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF A REPORTING UNIT OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT OR OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET OR SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR NETWORK OR GENERAL BUSINESS THAT NEGATIVELY AFFECTED THE RECORDED VALUE OF OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. WHILE THE GLOBAL RECESSION IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DELTA IS IMPLEMENTING VARIOUS INITIATIVES IN 2009 TO INCREASE REVENUES REDUCE COSTS AND PRESERVE LIQUIDITY. DELTA S ACTIONS INCLUDE (1) FOR TRAVEL BETWEEN THE U.S. AND EUROPE BEGINNING JULY 1 2009 CHARGING CUSTOMERS A 50 FEE TO CHECK A SECOND BAG (2) REMOVING CERTAIN AIRCRAFT FROM THE FLEET BY DECEMBER 31 2009 (3) REDUCING INTERNATIONAL CAPACITY BY 10 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER 2009 AND (4) OFFERING IN JANUARY 2009 VOLUNTARY EARLY OUT AND EARLY RETIREMENT PROGRAMS IN WHICH APPROXIMATELY 2 500 EMPLOYEES ELECTED TO PARTICIPATE. BASED UPON THIS EVALUATION WE CONCLUDED THERE WAS NO IMPAIRMENT AS WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY SUSTAINED DIMINISHING EFFECTS ON OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. -5- _________________________________________________________________ QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS AS NOTED BY THE STAFF DELTA EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN MARKET CAPITALIZATION DURING THE MARCH 2009 QUARTER. AS A RESULT WE EVALUATED GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT MARCH 31 2009. THE TABLE BELOW REPRESENTS THE ASSESSMENT AS OF MARCH 31 2009 OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT BASED ON OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION: MARCH 31 (IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA) 2009 NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING 772 PUBLICLY QUOTED COMMON STOCK PRICE AS OF MARCH 31 2009 5.63 MARKET VALUE OF EQUITY 4 346 BOOK VALUE OF EQUITY 519 POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT - BASED UPON THIS EVALUATION THE REPORTING UNIT S FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE BY 3.8 BILLION. 5. WE NOTE YOUR DISCLOSURE THAT AS A RESULT OF FRESH START REPORTING UPON EMERGENCE FROM BANKRUPTCY YOU RECORDED A 480 MILLION INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR MEMBERSHIP IN SKYTEAM. PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US WHY YOU BELIEVE IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO RECOGNIZE THIS INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE AS PART OF FRESH START ACCOUNTING AND TELL US HOW YOU DETERMINED OR CALCULATED THE VALUE. RESPONSE: SKYTEAM IS A GLOBAL AIRLINE ALLIANCE WHICH LINKS THE ROUTE NETWORKS OF ITS MEMBERS. IT PROVIDES PARTICIPATING AIRLINES WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCREASED CONNECTING TRAFFIC WHILE ENHANCING CUSTOMER SERVICE THROUGH CODESHARING ARRANGEMENTS RECIPROCAL FREQUENT FLYER AND AIRPORT LOUNGE PROGRAMS AND COORDINATED CARGO OPERATIONS THROUGH A COMMON BRAND. SINCE ITS FORMATION IN 2000 SKYTEAM HAS GROWN TO INCLUDE OVER TEN AIRLINES AROUND THE WORLD. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS GRANTED ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO SKYTEAM MEMBERS DELTA AIR FRANCE ALITALIA CSA CZECH AIRLINES AND KOREAN AIR ENABLING THOSE CARRIERS TO OFFER A MORE INTEGRATED ROUTE NETWORK AND DEVELOP COMMON SALES MARKETING AND DISCOUNT PROGRAMS FOR CUSTOMERS AS IF THEY WERE A SINGLE CARRIER. IN SUM SKYTEAM PERMITS DELTA TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DESTINATIONS INCREASE FLIGHT FREQUENCIES AND ACHIEVE GREATER NETWORK UTILIZATION THAN WOULD BE POSSIBLE ON A STANDALONE BASIS. PARAGRAPH 39 OF SFAS 141 REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF AN INTANGIBLE ASSET APART FROM GOODWILL IF IT ARISES FROM CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THOSE RIGHTS ARE TRANSFERABLE OR SEPARABLE. DELTA FIRST RECORDED ITS MEMBERSHIP IN SKYTEAM AS AN ASSET AS PART OF ITS ADOPTION OF FRESH START REPORTING ON APRIL 30 2007. WE RECOGNIZED DELTA S MEMBERSHIP IN SKYTEAM AS AN INTANGIBLE ASSET BECAUSE DELTA HAS CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH SKYTEAM ALLIANCE MEMBERS TO FORM A GLOBAL ALLIANCE THAT PROVIDES CUSTOMERS AN EXPANDED COVERAGE NETWORK. WE ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF DELTA S MEMBERSHIP IN THE SKYTEAM ALLIANCE USING AN INCOME APPROACH. USING PROJECTED CODESHARE REVENUE AND COST BY MEMBER THROUGH 2010 WE DETERMINED EBIT (EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES) AND THEN SUBTRACTED INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND CONTRIBUTORY ASSET CHARGES I.E. THE EXPECTED RETURNS ON TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHICH ARE EMPLOYED IN GENERATING THE INCOME ON THE SKYTEAM ALLIANCE SUCH AS FLIGHT EQUIPMENT AND THE TRADE NAME. WE GREW THE NET CASH FLOWS FOR THE SKYTEAM ALLIANCE BEYOND 2010 AT 3 PER YEAR. WE DISCOUNTED THE NET CASH FLOWS AT 15 TO REFLECT TIME VALUE OF MONEY AND RISK OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS. WE PERFORMED THIS CALCULATION FOR EACH MEMBER IN THE ALLIANCE TO ARRIVE AT A TOTAL ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF DELTA S MEMBERSHIP IN THE ALLIANCE. DELTA EXPECTS TO GAIN ECONOMIC BENEFIT FROM ITS SKYTEAM ALLIANCE MEMBERSHIP INDEFINITELY. GLOBAL ALLIANCES SUCH AS SKYTEAM ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVELERS. IT IS GENERALLY DISADVANTAGEOUS AND COSTLY FOR A MEMBER TO LEAVE THE ALLIANCE. MANY OPERATIONAL FACTORS (NETWORK SCHEDULE CODESHARE AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER ALLIANCE MEMBERS ETC.) ARE EMBEDDED IN THE ALLIANCE. THE SKYTEAM ALLIANCE AUTOMATICALLY RENEWS FOR AN UNLIMITED NUMBER OF FIVE YEAR TERMS UNLESS EXPRESSLY TERMINATED BY THE MEMBERS WITH SPECIFIED NOTICE. THERE ARE NO LEGAL REGULATORY OR CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS THAT LIMIT THE USEFUL LIFE OF SKYTEAM. BASED ON THESE FACTORS WE CONCLUDED THE SKYTEAM ALLIANCE TO BE INDEFINITE-LIVED. -6- _________________________________________________________________ NOTE 11. CHAPTER 11 PROCEEDINGS PAGE F-51 REORGANIZATION ITEMS NET - FOOTNOTE (1) 6. WE NOTE YOUR DISCLOSURE THAT YOU DISCHARGED OBLIGATIONS TO HOLDERS OF ALLOWED GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIMS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF 386 MILLION NEWLY ISSUED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AND THE ISSUANCE OF CERTAIN DEBT SECURITIES AND OBLIGATIONS. PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US AND REVISE YOUR DISCLOSURE TO INDICATE HOW YOU VALUED THE SHARES OF STOCK ISSUED. ALSO EXPLAIN HOW YOU VALUED AND ACCOUNTED FOR THE 89 MILLION SHARES RESERVED FOR FUTURE ISSUANCE UNDER DELTA S PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. RESPONSE: IN CONNECTION WITH DELTA S EMERGENCE FROM BANKRUPTCY ON APRIL 30 2007 WE ESTIMATED THE REORGANIZATION VALUE OF THE SUCCESSOR USING CONVENTIONAL VALUATION METHODS. THESE METHODS PRIMARILY INCLUDED A COMPARISON OF OUR PROJECTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TO THE MARKET VALUES OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES AND A CALCULATION OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. BASED ON THE ABOVE WE ESTIMATED THE REORGANIZATION VALUE OF THE SUCCESSOR TO BE BETWEEN 9.4 BILLION AND 12.0 BILLION. THE FRESH START CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET (SEE PAGE F-54) REFLECTS AN INITIAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY VALUE OF 9.4 BILLION REPRESENTING THE LOW END OF THE ESTIMATED RANGE AND REFLECTING MARKET CONDITIONS ON APRIL 30 2007. DELTA S PLAN OF REORGANIZATION CONTEMPLATES THE ISSUANCE OF 400 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK CONSISTING OF (1) 386 MILLION SHARES TO HOLDERS OF ALLOWED GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIMS TO DISCHARGE THESE CLAIMS AND (2) 14 MILLION SHARES TO APPROXIMATELY 39 000 NON-CONTRACT NON-MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE SHARES AS OF DECEMBER 31 2008: HOLDERS OF ALLOWED ELIGIBLE GENERAL NON-CONTRACT UNSECURED NON-MANAGEMENT (IN MILLIONS) CLAIMS EMPLOYEES TOTAL SHARES CONTEMPLATED TO BE DISTRIBUTED UNDER DELTA S PLAN OF REORGANIZATION 386 14 400 SHARES DISTRIBUTED AS OF DECEMBER 31 2008 297 14 311 SHARES HELD IN RESERVE FOR FUTURE ISSUANCE 89 - 89 PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DID NOT SEPARATELY VALUE FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES THE 386 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WHICH HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED OR ARE RESERVED FOR DISTRIBUTION TO HOLDERS OF ALLOWED GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIMS IN OUR CHAPTER 11 CASE. RATHER THESE SHARES REPRESENT AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE SUCCESSOR WHICH AS DISCUSSED ABOVE HAD AN INITIAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY VALUE OF 9.4 BILLION. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 16 (PAGE F-63) THE 89 MILLION SHARES THAT ARE RESERVED FOR DISTRIBUTION UNDER THE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION ARE INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2008. PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DISCUSS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INITIAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY VALUE AND THE ISSUANCE OF 400 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN NOTES 11 AND 12 RESPECTIVELY. -7- _________________________________________________________________ 7. WE NOTE THAT INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION OF THE GAIN ON DEBT DISCHARGE IS 938 MILLION (NET OF 22 MILLION DISCOUNT) OF NEW DEBT SECURITIES AND OBLIGATIONS. PLEASE PROVIDE US WITH AND DISCLOSE IN FUTURE FILINGS THE NATURE AND TERMS OF THIS DEBT. ALSO TELL US WHY THIS AMOUNT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE 1.5 BILLION EXIT FINANCING PRESENTED IN THE FRESH START CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. RESPONSE: NEW DEBT SECURITIES AND OBLIGATIONS AS DISCUSSED BELOW DELTA S PLAN OF REORGANIZATION PROVIDES THAT HOLDERS OF CERTAIN ALLOWED GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIMS WERE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE NEW DEBT SECURITIES OR IN LIEU OF SUCH DEBT SECURITIES CASH IN PARTIAL SATISFACTION OF THEIR CLAIMS: (IN MILLIONS) PRINCIPAL DISCOUNT TOTAL ALPA NOTES 650 (19 ) 631 PBGC NOTES 225 (3 ) 222 CINCINNATI NOTES 85 - 85 TOTAL 960 (22 ) 938 ALPA NOTES. IN 2006 DELTA ENTERED INTO A NEW COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH THE AIR LINE PILOTS ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL THE REPRESENTATIVE OF DELTA S PILOTS TO REDUCE DELTA S PILOT COSTS. IN EXCHANGE FOR PILOT PAY AND BENEFIT REDUCTIONS DELTA AGREED AMONG OTHER THINGS TO ISSUE FOR THE BENEFIT OF DELTA PILOTS WITHIN 120 DAYS AFTER DELTA S EMERGENCE FROM BANKRUPTCY SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES WITH AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT EQUAL TO 650 MILLION A TERM OF UP TO 15 YEARS AND AN ANNUAL INTEREST RATE CALCULATED TO ENSURE THE NOTES TRADE AT PAR ON THEIR ISSUANCE DATE ( PILOT NOTES ). CONSISTENT WITH ITS CONTRACTUAL RIGHT DELTA ELECTED IN 2007 TO PAY 650 MILLION IN CASH IN LIEU OF ISSUING THE PILOT NOTES. PBGC NOTES. IN 2006 DELTA ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION ( PBGC ) REGARDING THE TERMINATION OF THE QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN FOR DELTA PILOTS. UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THE PBGC AGREED TO BECOME THE TRUSTEE OF THE PILOT PENSION PLAN AND DELTA AGREED AMONG OTHER THINGS TO ISSUE TO THE PBGC WITHIN SEVEN DAYS AFTER DELTA S EMERGENCE FROM BANKRUPTCY SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES WITH AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT EQUAL TO 225 MILLION A TERM OF UP TO 15 YEARS AND AN ANNUAL INTEREST RATE CALCULATED TO ENSURE THE NOTES TRADE AT PAR ON THEIR ISSUANCE DATE ( PBGC NOTES ). BECAUSE DELTA ELECTED TO PAY THE PILOT NOTES IN CASH DELTA WAS REQUIRED TO PAY THE PBGC NOTES IN CASH. ACCORDINGLY IN 2007 DELTA PAID THE PBGC 225 MILLION IN LIEU OF ISSUING THE PBGC NOTES. CINCINNATI NOTES. IN 2007 DELTA ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE KENTON COUNTY AIRPORT BOARD AND THE TRUSTEE FOR CERTAIN BONDS TO RESTRUCTURE DELTA S LEASE AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS AT THE CINCINNATI-NORTHERN KENTUCKY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. PURSUANT TO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON MAY 3 2007 DELTA ISSUED TO THE BOND TRUSTEE ON BEHALF OF THE BONDHOLDERS SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES WITH AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT EQUAL TO 66 MILLION AN INTEREST RATE OF 8 AND A TERM ENDING ON DECEMBER 1 2015 ( CINCINNATI NOTES ). THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE CINCINNATI NOTES WAS REDUCED FROM 85 MILLION TO 66 MILLION DUE TO THE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN PAYMENTS DELTA MADE IN 2006 AND 2007. WE BELIEVE THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE APPROPRIATELY DISCLOSED IN FOOTNOTES (A) AND (B) TO THE DEBT DISCHARGE RECLASSIFICATIONS AND DISTRIBUTION TO CREDITORS SECTION IN NOTE 11 (PAGE F-55). -8- _________________________________________________________________ EXIT FINANCING PLEASE NOTE THE EXIT FACILITIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) ARE UNRELATED TO THE PILOT NOTES THE PBGC NOTES AND THE CINCINNATI NOTES DISCUSSED ABOVE. ON APRIL 30 2007 THE DATE DELTA EMERGED FROM BANKRUPTCY DELTA ENTERED INTO A CREDIT FACILITY TO BORROW UP TO 2.5 BILLION ( EXIT FACILITIES ). INFORMATION REGARDING THE EXIT FACILITIES IS INCLUDED IN THE DELTA EXIT FINANCING SECTION IN NOTE 6 (PAGE F-32). ON APRIL 30 2007 DELTA BORROWED 1.5 BILLION UNDER THE EXIT FACILITIES. DELTA USED THE PROCEEDS FROM THIS BORROWING AND EXISTING CASH TO REPAY THE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER ITS THEN EXISTING DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION FINANCING FACILITIES. FOOTNOTE (2) PAGE F-52 8. WE NOTE FROM YOUR DISCLOSURE THAT YOU REVALUED YOUR SKYMILES FREQUENT FLIER OBLIGATION AT FAIR VALUE AS A RESULT OF FRESH START REPORTING WHICH RESULTED IN A 2.6 BILLION REORGANIZATION CHARGE. WE ALSO NOTE THAT IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR EMERGENCE FROM BANKRUPTCY YOU CHANGED THE ACCOUNTING POLICY FROM AN INCREMENTAL COST BASIS TO A DEFERRED REVENUE MODEL FOR MILES EARNED THROUGH TRAVEL. PLEASE TELL US AND DISCLOSE IN YOUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HOW YOU DETERMINED OR CALCULATED THE 2.6 BILLION ADJUSTMENT. AS PART OF YOUR RESPONSE PLEASE TELL US THE AMOUNT OF THE ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY AND THE AMOUNT RELATED TO REVALUATION OF THE LIABILITY AS PART OF FRESH START ACCOUNTING. RESPONSE: AS A RESULT OF OUR ADOPTION OF FRESH START REPORTING UPON EMERGENCE FROM BANKRUPTCY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 157 WE REVALUED OUR SKYMILES FREQUENT FLYER LIABILITY TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE RESULTING IN A 2.6 BILLION CHARGE RECORDED TO REORGANIZATION ITEMS NET. PLEASE NOTE THE CALCULATION OF THE 2.6 BILLION CHARGE IS DISCLOSED IN FOOTNOTE (E) TO THE FRESH START CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IN NOTE 11 (PAGES F-55 AND F-56). SPECIFICALLY FOOTNOTE (E) STATES IN PART THAT: THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SKYMILES FREQUENT FLYER AWARD LIABILITY WAS DETERMINED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED PRICE THAT THIRD PARTIES WOULD REQUIRE US TO PAY FOR THEM TO ASSUME THE OBLIGATION FOR MILES EXPECTED TO BE REDEEMED UNDER THE SKYMILES PROGRAM. THIS ESTIMATED PRICE WAS DETERMINED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE EQUIVALENT TICKET VALUE OF A SKYMILES AWARD REDEEMED FOR TRAVEL ON DELTA OR A PARTICIPATING AIRLINE. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE EQUIVALENT TICKET VALUE CONTEMPLATES DIFFERING CLASSES OF SERVICE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ITINERARIES AND THE CARRIER PROVIDING THE AWARD TRAVEL. AT APRIL 30 2007 WE RECORDED DEFERRED REVENUE EQUAL TO 0.0083 FOR EACH MILE WE ESTIMATE WILL ULTIMATELY BE REDEEMED UNDER THE SKYMILES PROGRAM. UPON EMERGENCE FROM BANKRUPTCY WE CHANGED OUR ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR THE SKYMILES PROGRAM TO A DEFERRED REVENUE MODEL FOR ALL FREQUENT FLYER MILES. THIS CHANGE DID NOT IMPACT THE CALCULATION OF THE 2.6 BILLION CHARGE. FOOTNOTE (3) PAGE F-52 9. WE NOTE YOUR DISCLOSURE THAT YOU RECORDED A 238 MILLION GAIN AS A REORGANIZATION ITEM DUE TO THE REVALUATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AS A RESULT OF FRESH START REPORTING. PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US HOW YOU CALCULATED THIS GAIN AND WHY IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO RECORD THIS GAIN ON THE INCOME STATEMENT. WE WOULD ASSUME THAT THE REVALUATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF FRESH START REPORTING WOULD BE PART OF THE ALLOCATION OF THE REORGANIZATION VALUE WHICH RESULTED IN GOODWILL AND WOULD NOT AFFECT THE INCOME STATEMENT. PLEASE ADVISE OR REVISE ACCORDINGLY. -9- _________________________________________________________________ RESPONSE: IN ACCORDANCE WITH PARAGRAPH 39 OF SOP 90-7 WE RECORDED THE 238 MILLION VALUATION ADJUSTMENT AS A GAIN TO REORGANIZATION ITEMS NET ON THE PREDECESSOR S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FOUR MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30 2007. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS HOW WE CALCULATED THE 238 MILLION GAIN.
