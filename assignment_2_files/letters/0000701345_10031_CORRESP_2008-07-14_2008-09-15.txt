PLEASE EXPLAIN IN GREATER DETAIL YOUR ACCOUNTING FOR YOUR OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO 1.85 BILLION IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF PASS THROUGH TRUST CERTIFICATES. IN YOUR RESPONSE TELL US WHY YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR ACCOUNTING IS APPROPRIATE. RESPONSE: THE COMPANY HAS OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO PASS THROUGH TRUST CERTIFICATES ALSO KNOWN AS ENHANCED EQUIPMENT TRUST CERTIFICATES OR EETCS ISSUED BY PASS THROUGH TRUSTS TO COVER THE FINANCING OF 19 OWNED AIRCRAFT 116 LEASED AIRCRAFT AND THREE LEASED ENGINES. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THESE TRUSTS IS TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OF AIRCRAFT. RATHER THAN FINANCE EACH AIRCRAFT SEPARATELY WHEN SUCH AIRCRAFT IS PURCHASED OR DELIVERED THESE TRUSTS ALLOWED THE COMPANY TO RAISE THE FINANCING FOR SEVERAL AIRCRAFT AT ONE TIME AND PLACE SUCH FUNDS IN ESCROW PENDING THE PURCHASE OR DELIVERY OF THE RELEVANT AIRCRAFT. EACH TRUST COVERED A SET AMOUNT OF AIRCRAFT SCHEDULED TO BE DELIVERED WITHIN A SPECIFIC PERIOD OF TIME. AT THE TIME OF EACH COVERED AIRCRAFT FINANCING THE RELEVANT TRUST USED THE FUNDS IN ESCROW TO PURCHASE EQUIPMENT NOTES RELATING TO THE FINANCED AIRCRAFT. THE EQUIPMENT NOTES WERE ISSUED AT THE COMPANY S ELECTION IN CONNECTION WITH A MORTGAGE FINANCING OF THE AIRCRAFT OR BY A SEPARATE OWNER TRUST IN CONNECTION WITH A LEVERAGED LEASE FINANCING OF THE AIRCRAFT. IN THE CASE OF A LEVERAGED LEASE FINANCING THE OWNER TRUST THEN LEASED THE AIRCRAFT TO THE COMPANY. IN BOTH CASES THE EQUIPMENT NOTES ARE SECURED BY A SECURITY INTEREST IN THE AIRCRAFT. THE PASS THROUGH TRUST CERTIFICATES ARE NOT DIRECT OBLIGATIONS OF NOR ARE THEY GUARANTEED BY THE COMPANY. HOWEVER IN THE CASE OF MORTGAGE FINANCINGS THE EQUIPMENT NOTES ISSUED TO THE TRUSTS ARE DIRECT OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY. AS OF DECEMBER 31 2007 AND MARCH 31 2008 576 MILLION AND 554 MILLION RESPECTIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE MORTGAGE FINANCINGS IS REFLECTED AS DEBT ON THE COMPANY S BALANCE SHEET. 4 _________________________________________________________________ WITH RESPECT TO LEVERAGED LEASES THE COMPANY EVALUATED WHETHER THEY HAD CHARACTERISTICS OF A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY AS DEFINED BY FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46(R) CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES ( FIN 46 ). THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THE LEASING ENTITIES MET THE CRITERIA FOR VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES. THE COMPANY THEN EVALUATED WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY BY EVALUATING WHETHER OR NOT THE COMPANY WAS EXPOSED TO THE MAJORITY OF THE RISKS (EXPECTED LOSSES) OR WHETHER IT RECEIVES THE MAJORITY OF THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS (EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS) FROM THE TRUSTS ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT PROVIDE RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES TO THE BONDHOLDERS OR EQUITY PARTICIPANTS IN THE TRUSTS. EACH LEASE DOES HAVE A FIXED PRICE PURCHASE OPTION THAT ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO PURCHASE THE AIRCRAFT NEAR THE END OF THE LEASE TERM. HOWEVER THE OPTION PRICE APPROXIMATES AN ESTIMATE OF THE AIRCRAFT S FAIR MARKET VALUE AT THE OPTION DATE. THE COMPANY UNDER THIS FEATURE DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN ANY INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE COMPANY CONCLUDED IT WAS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. AS THE COMPANY WAS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY AND CONCLUDED THE TRUSTS WERE NOT REQUIRED TO BE CONSOLIDATED THE COMPANY THEN APPLIED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 13 ACCOUNTING FOR LEASES TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE LEASES SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS CAPITAL OR OPERATING. THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT ALL QUALIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES. IN ITS FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2007 THE COMPANY INCLUDED IN NOTE 10(C) TO THE GROUP CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (PAGE 103) THE KEY FACTORS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE SUPPORTING THE COMPANY S ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR ITS OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO EETCS. IN THE COMPANY S SECOND QUARTER 2008 FORM 10-Q AND IN FUTURE FILINGS THE COMPANY WILL ADD THE FOLLOWING CLARIFYING LANGUAGE TO ITS DISCLOSURE: O THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS EETC LEVERAGED LEASE FINANCINGS AS OPERATING LEASES UNDER THE CRITERIA OF SFAS NO. 13. THE TOTAL OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE LEVERAGED LEASE FINANCINGS IS XX BILLION AS OF JUNE 30 2008. FORM 10-Q: FOR QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31 2008 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET -- GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS PAGE 6 COMMENT 5. WE NOTE THAT YOUR COMMON SHARE PRICE AND OVERALL MARKET CAPITALIZATION HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED DURING THE INTERIM PERIODS IN FISCAL 2008. IN ADDITION YOUR TOTAL MARKET CAPITALIZATION CURRENTLY APPROXIMATES 225 MILLION WHILE YOUR 1.163 BILLION OF BOOK VALUE WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDS YOUR TOTAL MARKET CAPITALIZATION IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL ( 622 MILLION) AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ( 547 MILLION) ASSETS REFLECTED ON YOUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. WE ALSO NOTE THAT SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGES IN BUSINESS CLIMATE AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THROUGH MATERIAL CHANGES IN FUEL PRICES HAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED YOUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS MATERIAL OPERATING LOSSES ARE REFLECTED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2008 WITH A FORECAST OF CONTINUING MATERIAL OPERATING LOSSES IF FUEL PRICES CONTINUE AT CURRENT LEVELS. FURTHERMORE THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY APPEARS HEADED FOR ADDITIONAL CHALLENGING TIMES WITH AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN WHEREAS A SOFTENING ECONOMY MAKES REALIZING ANTICIPATED YIELD AMOUNTS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN. 5 _________________________________________________________________ FROM DISCLOSURES IN CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICES AND ESTIMATES (MD A) AND THE ACCOUNTING POLICY NOTES FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES AS PROVIDED IN YOUR DECEMBER 31 2007 FORM 10-K WE NOTE THAT YOU PERFORM AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST ON OCTOBER 1^ST IN EACH YEAR UNLESS EVENTS OR CHANGES INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE ASSETS. IN TESTING FOR IMPAIRMENT YOU ALSO STATE YOU ASSESS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS BASED ON THE MARKET APPROACH WHERE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR US AIRWAYS GROUP COMMON STOCK AND ITS NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING. THE MATERIAL DECLINE IN THE COMPANY S MARKET CAPITALIZATION AND ITS DISPARITY WITH BOOK VALUE COUPLED WITH THE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGES IN BUSINESS CLIMATE THROUGH MATERIAL CHANGES IN FUEL PRICES AND ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN MAY BE INDICATIVE OF A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF THE COMPANY S RECORDED INVESTMENT IN ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. AS AVIATION FUEL EXPENSE IS YOUR LARGEST OPERATING COST AND OPERATING RESULTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY EVEN A RELATIVELY SMALL INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF AIRCRAFT FUEL TOGETHER WITH THE MARKET APPROACH BEING A METHOD YOU USE TO ASSESS IMPAIRMENT WE BELIEVE THAT MATERIAL ADVERSE EVENTS AND CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED IN THESE ITEMS THAT MAY REQUIRE THE TESTING OF IMPAIRMENT FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS BEFORE THE ANNUAL TESTING SCHEDULED TO BE PERFORMED ON OCTOBER 1 2008. PLEASE REFER TO THE GUIDANCE AS PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPHS 28 AND 8 OF SFAS 142 AND 144 RESPECTIVELY. AS SUCH PLEASE PROVIDE US WITH A CURRENT DETAILED IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS AND ADVISE US WHAT CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO RECOGNIZING AN IMPAIRMENT OF THE COMPANY S RECORDED INVESTMENT IN GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS THROUGH THIS ANALYSIS. AS PART OF YOUR RESPONSE PLEASE ALSO SPECIFICALLY PROVIDE US A SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL RELEVANT SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES UNDERLYING YOUR PREVIOUS IMPAIRMENT ANALYSES PREPARED WITH RESPECT TO GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES AND HOW THE ASSUMPTIONS ESTIMATES AND PROJECTIONS HAVE CHANGED OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS AND HOW THE ASSUMPTIONS ESTIMATES AND PROJECTIONS USED IN THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS COMPARE WITH THE ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN FISCAL 2007 AND SIX MONTH FISCAL 2008 INTERIM PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30^TH. IN ADDITION PLEASE PROVIDE US WITH ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT YOU BELIEVE WOULD ASSIST US IN OUR REVIEW. AFTER THIS FURTHER ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSIS WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE NOTES TO YOUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SHOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED TO SUMMARIZE THE EVENTS AND CHANGES THAT LED TO AN IMPAIRMENT TEST BEFORE YOUR SCHEDULED ANNUAL ASSESSMENT AS WELL AS YOUR ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS OF THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS. THIS DISCLOSURE SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE TEST AS WELL AS DETAILED INFORMATION THAT SUPPORTS MANAGEMENT S CONCLUSION ON IMPAIRMENT. 6 _________________________________________________________________ RESPONSE: FIRST QUARTER 2008 IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 142 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES ( SFAS 142 ) PARAGRAPH NO. 28 THE COMPANY CAREFULLY CONSIDERED WHETHER EVENTS HAD OCCURRED OR CIRCUMSTANCES HAD CHANGED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008 AND DURING THE PERIOD FROM APRIL 1 2008 THROUGH THE DATE OF THE FILING OF OUR FIRST QUARTER FORM 10-Q ON APRIL 24 2008 (THE FIRST QUARTER PERIOD ) WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO PERFORM INTERIM PERIOD TESTING FOR IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL. THE FOLLOWING FACTORS WERE CONSIDERED: O REVENUE TRENDS O FUEL COSTS O FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE O STOCK PRICE O CAPACITY REDUCTIONS O CREDIT RATINGS MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT AS OF THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER AND THROUGH THE APRIL 24 2008 FILING OF OUR FIRST QUARTER FORM 10-Q NO EVENTS OR CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES HAD OCCURRED THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO PERFORM INTERIM PERIOD TESTING FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. THE FOLLOWING KEY FACTS WERE RELIED UPON IN REACHING THE CONCLUSION: O THROUGHOUT THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008 THE REVENUE ENVIRONMENT HAD REMAINED STRONG WITH FUTURE REVENUE TRENDS REMAINING POSITIVE. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008 THE COMPANY REALIZED AN INCREASE IN PASSENGER REVENUE PER AVAILABLE SEAT MILE ( PRASM ) OF 3.7 OVER THE 2007 PERIOD. O ALTHOUGH FUEL COSTS HAD RISEN THEY CONTINUED TO BE HIGHLY VOLATILE. IN THE LAST WEEK OF DECEMBER OF 2007 THE PRICE PER BARREL OF OIL WAS 96 AND INCREASED TO A THEN RECORD HIGH OF 100 PER BARREL IN EARLY JANUARY 2008. IN EARLY FEBRUARY OIL FELL TO 89 PER BARREL AND THEN PEAKED AGAIN TO ANOTHER THEN RECORD HIGH OF 110 PER BARREL. AT MARCH 31 2008 OIL AGAIN HAD DECREASED TO 102 PER BARREL. A DOLLAR PER BARREL CHANGE IN THE PRICE OF OIL RESULTS IN A 37 MILLION INCREASE OR DECREASE IN OUR ANNUAL EXPENSE. O THE ACTUAL LOSS REPORTED FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008 WAS LESS THAN WHAT WAS INCLUDED IN OUR 2008 BUSINESS PLAN. THIS PLAN INCLUDED A PER BARREL OIL COST WHICH WAS GENERALLY IN LINE WITH THE COST OF OIL AT MARCH 31 2008. O THE STOCK PRICE OF THE COMPANY WHICH HAD BEEN IMPACTED LARGELY BY CHANGES IN FUEL PRICES WAS VERY VOLATILE. THE COMPANY S STOCK CLOSED AT 14.71 ON DECEMBER 31 2007 TRADED AS HIGH AS 15.39 IN EARLY FEBRUARY 2008 HIT A LOW OF 7.45 ON MARCH 17 2008 AND CLOSED AT 8.91 ON MARCH 31 2008. THE STOCK THEN CLOSED AS HIGH AS 9.87 ON APRIL 8 2008. 7 _________________________________________________________________ O AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008 THE COMPANY HAD PLANS TO REDUCE CAPACITY BY TWO TO FOUR PERCENT IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2008 THROUGH MANAGEMENT OF SCHEDULED LEASED AIRCRAFT RETURNS. O AS OF MARCH 31 2008 THE COMPANY HAD NOT EXPERIENCED ANY DOWNGRADE IN ITS CREDIT RATING AS ITS S P AND MOODY S RATINGS REMAINED AT B- AND CCC SINCE THE TIME OF ITS LAST ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST. IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2008 FORM 10-Q THE COMPANY INCLUDED IN ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL DISCLOSURE (PAGE 38) WHICH SUMMARIZED THE KEY FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE SUPPORTING OUR CONCLUSION THAT NO EVENTS OR CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES HAD OCCURRED THAT WOULD REQUIRE AN INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT REVIEW. THE COMPANY ALSO STATED IN THAT DISCLOSURE THAT IT WAS CONTINUING TO MONITOR THOSE FACTORS AND THAT ADVERSE CHANGES SUCH AS CONTINUED RECORD HIGH FUEL PRICES A WEAKENING REVENUE ENVIRONMENT OR SIGNIFICANT SUSTAINED DECLINES IN OUR STOCK PRICE COULD RESULT IN A PARTIAL OR TOTAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR 622 MILLION GOODWILL BALANCE. SECOND QUARTER 2008 IN ACCORDANCE WITH PARAGRAPH 28 OF SFAS NO. 142 IN LATE MAY 2008 THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT EVENTS HAD OCCURRED AND CIRCUMSTANCES HAD CHANGED WHICH REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO PERFORM AN INTERIM PERIOD GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 142. THE FOLLOWING KEY FACTORS WERE RELIED UPON IN REACHING OUR CONCLUSION: O THE PRICE OF FUEL BECAME LESS VOLATILE AND THERE WAS A SUSTAINED SURGE IN RECORD HIGH FUEL PRICES. ON MAY 20 2008 THE PRICE PER BARREL OF OIL HIT A THEN RECORD HIGH OF 133 PER BARREL AND FROM THAT DATE THROUGH JUNE 30 2008 STAYED AT AN AVERAGE DAILY PRICE OF 133 PER BARREL. OUR AVERAGE MAINLINE FUEL PRICE DURING APRIL AND MAY OF 2008 WAS 3.47 PER GALLON AS COMPARED TO 2.88 PER GALLON IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008 AND 2.20 FOR THE FULL YEAR 2007. THIS INCREASE IN THE PRICE PER GALLON OF FUEL REPRESENTS AN INCREASE OF 20 AND 58 AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER 2008 AND FULL YEAR 2007 RESPECTIVELY. O AS A RESULT OF SUSTAINED RECORD HIGH FUEL PRICES THE COMPANY REVISED ITS FORECASTED LOSS FOR 2008 TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN ITS ORIGINAL 2008 BUSINESS PLAN. O DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008 WE EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN MARKET CAPITALIZATION DUE TO OVERALL AIRLINE INDUSTRY CONDITIONS DRIVEN BY SUSTAINED RECORD HIGH FUEL PRICES. OUR AVERAGE STOCK PRICE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008 WAS 6.13 AS COMPARED TO AN AVERAGE OF 12.15 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008 A DECLINE OF 50 . O THE COMPANY MADE PLANS WHICH WERE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED ON JUNE 12 2008 IN RESPONSE TO THE SUSTAINED SURGE IN RECORD HIGH FUEL PRICES TO REDUCE FOURTH QUARTER 2008 AND FULL YEAR 2009 DOMESTIC MAINLINE CAPACITY BY SIX TO EIGHT PERCENT AND SEVEN TO NINE PERCENT RESPECTIVELY ON A YEAR OVER YEAR BASIS THROUGH RETURNING 10 MAINLINE AIRCRAFT IN 2008 AND 2009 CANCELING THE LEASES OF TWO A330 AIRCRAFT THAT WERE SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY IN 2009 AND PLANNING TO REDUCE ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT IN 2009 AND 2010. THE COMPANY ALSO ANNOUNCED IT WAS DECREASING ITS STAFFING LEVELS IN RESPONSE TO THE REDUCED CAPACITY. 8 _________________________________________________________________ O DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008 S P AND MOODY S PLACED THE COMPANY ON NEGATIVE CREDIT WATCH. WE PERFORMED THE FIRST STEP OF THE TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRED BY SFAS NO. 142 AND COMPARED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. CONSISTENT WITH OUR APPROACH IN OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING IN ASSESSING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT WE CONSIDERED BOTH THE MARKET APPROACH AND THE INCOME APPROACH. UNDER THE MARKET APPROACH THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES AND THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. THE INCOME APPROACH IS DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MARKET GROWTH TRENDS FORECASTED REVENUES AND EXPENSES EXPECTED PERIODS THAT THE ASSETS WILL BE UTILIZED APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND OTHER VARIABLES. WE CONCLUDED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT WAS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS OF THE REPORTING UNIT AND THUS WE PERFORMED STEP TWO OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST. IN STEP TWO OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST WE DETERMINED THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL AND COMPARED IT TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 142 WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A THIRD PARTY VALUATION FIRM WE ALLOCATED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO ALL OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS IF THE REPORTING UNIT HAD BEEN ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT WAS THE PRICE PAID TO ACQUIRE THE REPORTING UNIT. THE EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT OVER THE AMOUNTS ASSIGNED TO ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IS THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL. OUR STEP TWO ANALYSIS RESULTED IN NO IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL AND THEREFORE WE WILL REPORT IN OUR SECOND QUARTER 2008 RESULTS AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF 622 MILLION REPRESENTING A WRITE-OFF OF THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF OUR PREVIOUSLY RECORDED GOODWILL. AS REQUESTED THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL RELEVANT SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES UNDERLYING THE COMPANY S PREVIOUS IMPAIRMENT ANALYSES PREPARED WITH RESPECT TO GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS AS COMPARED TO THE ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN 2007 AND THE FIRST HALF OF 2008: 9 _________________________________________________________________ INCOME APPROACH-DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD: PROJECTED MAINLINE DEBT-FREE NET CASH FLOWS (IN MILLIONS): VALUATION DATE 2006 2007 Q1 2008 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 10/1/2006 125 137 N/A 148 676 771 858 N/A N/A 10/1/2007 N/A (73 ) N/A (169 ) 307 511 581 692 755 6/9/2008 N/A N/A (223 ) (1 013 ) (500 ) (103 ) 164 362 580 ACTUAL RESULTS 367 90 (223 ) N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Q2 2008 RESULTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN FINALIZED AS OF THE DATE OF THIS LETTER. 10/1/2006 10/1/2007 6/9/2008 DISCOUNT RATE 11.4 12.8 14.0 INVESTED CAPITAL VALUE 8 500 6 700 4 000 MARKET CAPITALIZATION APPROACH: 10/1/2006 10/1/2007 6/9/2008 STOCK PRICE 44.33 27.46 3.92 INVESTED CAPITAL VALUE 6 300 5 300 3 600 GUIDELINE COMPANIES APPROACH: 10/1/2006 10/1/2007 6/9/2008 REVENUE MULTIPLE 0.6 0.5 N/A EBITDAR MULTIPLE 4.6 3.6 N/A INVESTED CAPITAL VALUE 8 000 7 800 N/A STEP 1 ANALYSIS: 10/1/2006 10/1/2007 6/9/2008 CONCLUDED INVESTED CAPITAL VALUE (1) 7 800 6 600 3 700 COMPANY CARRYING VALUE (2) 3 862 4 552 4 506 (1) CONCLUDED INVESTED CAPITAL WAS ESTIMATED USING THE FOLLOWING WEIGHTING OF THE VALUATION METHODS ABOVE: 10/1/2006 10/1/2007 6/9/2008 INCOME APPROACH 50 50 33 MARKET CAPITALIZATION APPROACH 25 25 67 GUIDELINE COMPANIES APPROACH 25 25 N/A (2) COMPANY CARRYING VALUE WAS CALCULATED AS FOLLOWS: 10/1/2006 10/1/2007 6/9/2008 NET ASSETS 892 1 463 1 189 TOTAL DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS 2 970 3 089 3 317 COMPANY CARRYING VALUE 3 862 4 552 4 506 THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSES DESCRIBED ABOVE WERE PREPARED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A THIRD PARTY VALUATION FIRM.

IN CONNECTION WITH COMPLETING STEP TWO OF OUR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS WE ASSESSED THE CURRENT FAIR MARKET VALUES OF OUR SIGNIFICANT INTANGIBLE AND TANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDING OWNED AIRCRAFT AIRCRAFT LEASES AIRCRAFT SPARE PARTS AIRPORT SLOTS INTERNATIONAL ROUTES AND TRADEMARKS. THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE ONLY ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT THAT HAD OCCURRED WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECLINE IN FAIR MARKET VALUE OF CERTAIN SPARE PARTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS BOEING 737 FLEET. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES ITS SECOND QUARTER 2008 FORM 10-Q WILL REPORT AN 18 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR CERTAIN BOEING 737 FLEET SPARE PARTS.
