FORM 10-K FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2011 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS PAGE 42 1. REFER TO YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT 2. IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHY YOUR DISCLOSURE SOLELY FOCUSES ON THE ENGINE MAINTENANCE EXPENSES OF THE 96 CRJ 200 AIRCRAFT COVERED BY THE UNITED EXPRESS CONTRACT FLYING AGREEMENTS WHEN BASED ON THE TABLE ON PAGE 41 IT APPEARS THERE ARE 141 OTHER AIRCRAFT (I.E. 36 ERJ 145S 70 CRJ 700S AND 35 EMB 120S) ALSO COVERED BY THESE AGREEMENTS. PLEASE ADVISE. 2. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ABOVE COMMENT IT APPEARS FROM YOUR DISCLOSURES THAT YOUR SKYWEST AIRLINES ALASKA CAPACITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND SKYWEST AIRLINES US AIRWAYS EXPRESS AGREEMENT (TOGETHER AGREEMENTS ) HAVE SIMILAR TERMS AS THE UNITED EXPRESS AGREEMENTS. PRESUMABLY YOU ARE COMPENSATED UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS FOR AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE EXPENSE INCLUDING ENGINE MAINTENANCE EXPENSE AT FIXED HOURLY RATES SIMILAR TO THAT UNDER THE UNITED EXPRESS AGREEMENTS AS INDICATED IN YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT 2. ACCORDINGLY IT MICHAEL J. KRAUPP SKYWEST INC. JANUARY 17 2013 PAGE 2 REASONS THAT THE REVENUE EARNED EACH REPORTING PERIOD UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS WILL NOT DIRECTLY MATCH THE ENGINE EXPENSE INCURRED EACH REPORTING PERIOD LIKE THAT UNDER THE UNITED EXPRESS AGREEMENTS AS INDICATED IN YOUR RESPONSE. HOWEVER YOUR DISCLOSURE ONLY ADDRESSES THE ENGINE MAINTENANCE EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNITED EXPRESS AGREEMENTS SO IT APPEARS THAT INVESTORS ARE NOT BEING INFORMED OF THE FULL FINANCIAL IMPACT RESULTING FROM ENGINE MAINTENANCE EVENTS INCURRED UNDER ALL SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN COMPARABLE REPORTING PERIODS. PLEASE ADVISE. CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS PAGE 65 3. REFER TO YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT 5 WHEREBY IT APPEARS THAT YOUR CONTRACT FLYING AGREEMENTS DO NOT SEPARATE RENTING THE AIRCRAFT FROM OPERATING THE AIRCRAFT. CONSISTENT WITH YOUR RESPONSE PLEASE FURTHER EXPAND YOUR DISCLOSURE IN OTHER REVENUE ITEMS ON PAGE 75 WITHIN NOTE (1) TO DISCLOSE WHY YOU BELIEVE THAT PRESENTING RENTAL INCOME AND RELATED EXPENSE SEPARATELY ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS WILL NOT BE APPROPRIATE UNDER YOUR CIRCUMSTANCE. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE (1) NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES PASSENGER AND GROUND HANDLING REVENUES PAGE 72 4. REFER TO YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT 6. TO ENHANCE YOUR CURRENT DISCLOSURE WE BELIEVE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER EXPANDING THE NOTE TO SPECIFICALLY PROVIDE THAT THE ANCILLARY SOURCES OF OTHER REVENUES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH AIRLINES ARE RETAINED BY YOUR MAJOR AIRLINE PARTNERS ON FLIGHTS THAT THE COMPANY OPERATES UNDER ITS CODE-SHARE AGREEMENTS.
