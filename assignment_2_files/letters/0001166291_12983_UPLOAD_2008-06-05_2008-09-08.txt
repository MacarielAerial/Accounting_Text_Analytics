WE NOTE YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT 3 HOWEVER WE DO NOT AGREE WITH YOUR CONCLUSION THAT THE 4.1 MILLION LOSS ON THE SALE OF THE NORTHWEST BANKRUPTCY CLAIM SHOULD BE RECORDED AS A NONOPERATING LOSS. AS RECEIVABLES FROM DEBTORS REGARDLESS OF BANKRUPTCY ARE NOT SECURITIES UNDER SFAS 115 IT IS UNCLEAR WHY YOU CHOSE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE LOSS FROM THE CLAIM AS NONOPERATING CONSIDERING THAT ALL OTHER AMOUNTS RELATED TO THE NORTHWEST BANKRUPTCY ARE PART OF YOUR OPERATIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS. WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THE BANKRUPTCY CLAIM AROSE AS A RESULT OF YOUR NORMAL OPERATIONS UNDER THE ASA WITH NORTHWEST AND THEREFORE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAN ANY GAIN OR LOSS ON ITS SALE OR DISPOSITION SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN OPERATING INCOME CONSISTENT WITH THE OTHER PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES AND DECREASES OF PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE NORTHWEST AND MESABA BANKRUPTCY FILINGS. PLEASE CONFIRM THAT YOU WILL REVISE YOUR CLASSIFICATION IN FUTURE FILINGS SO THAT IT IS INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME FROM OPERATIONS.
