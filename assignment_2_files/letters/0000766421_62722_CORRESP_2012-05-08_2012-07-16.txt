THIS TITLE IS TOO SIMILAR TO THE GAAP TERMINOLOGY. REFER TO THE GUIDANCE IN ITEM 10(E)(1)(II)(E) OF REGULATION S-K.

WE NOTE FROM YOUR DISCLOSURE ON PAGE 40 THAT 31 OF YOUR AIRCRAFT ARE UNENCUMBERED AND FROM YOUR DISCLOSURE IN NOTE 6 THAT ALL OF YOUR BORROWINGS ARE SECURED BY AIRCRAFT. PLEASE REVISE YOUR DISCUSSION OF OUTSTANDING DEBT HERE AND IN NOTE 6 TO DISCUSS THE SPECIFIC COVENANTS TO WHICH YOU ARE OBLIGATED. TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE COVENANTS CONTAIN AIRCRAFT LOAN TO FAIR MARKET VALUE REQUIREMENTS PLEASE SO STATE AND QUANTIFY TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE THE PERCENTAGE BY WHICH FAIR MARKET VALUE EXCEEDS THE AIRCRAFT LOAN AMOUNTS AS OF THE MOST RECENT BALANCE SHEET DATE. INCLUDE A DRAFT OF YOUR INTENDED DISCLOSURE WITH YOUR RESPONSE. RESPONSE: ALL OF THE COMPANY S BORROWINGS ARE SECURED BY AIRCRAFT BUT ONLY ONE AIRCRAFT DEBT AGREEMENT SECURED BY THREE AIRCRAFT HAS A LOAN-TO-VALUE COVENANT. THE COVENANT REQUIRES THAT WE MAINTAIN AN APPRAISED VALUE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN 131 OF THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE AS OF THE APPRAISAL DATE WHICH IS ANNUALLY ON THE CLOSEST BUSINESS DAY TO FEBRUARY 15TH. IF THERE IS A SHORTFALL IN VALUE THEN A PRINCIPAL PAYMENT IS DUE IN ORDER TO BRING THE APPRAISED VALUE EQUAL TO 131 . AS OF DECEMBER 31 2010 AND DECEMBER 31 2011 THE TOTAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS SPECIFIC AGREEMENT WAS 41.6 MILLION AND 34.3 MILLION WITH APPRAISED VALUES OF 148 AND 171 RESPECTIVELY. IN FUTURE FILINGS WE WILL DISCLOSE THE FOLLOWING: FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDING JUNE 30 2012 PART I. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ITEM 1. NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) NOTE 7. LONG-TERM DEBT ...ALL OF THE COMPANY S BORROWINGS ARE SECURED BY AIRCRAFT BUT ONLY ONE AIRCRAFT DEBT AGREEMENT SECURED BY THREE AIRCRAFT HAS A LOAN-TO-VALUE COVENANT. AS OF JUNE 30 2012 THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS COVENANT AND EXPECTS TO RETIRE THIS DEBT BY DECEMBER 31 2012. ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ANALYSIS OF OUR CASH FLOWS CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES ...ONE OF OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS SECURED BY THREE AIRCRAFT HAS A LOAN-TO-VALUE COVENANT. THE BALANCE ON THIS AGREEMENT AS OF JUNE 30 2012 WAS XX MILLION. BECAUSE THE CURRENT LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO EXCEEDS THE REQUIREMENT BY A COMFORTABLE MARGIN WE DO NOT EXPECT THIS COVENANT TO HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION. CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS PAGE 50 3. REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE SECOND PARAGRAPH IN YOUR REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING POLICY IN NOTE 1 ON PAGE 56. WE NOTE THAT PASSENGER REVENUES INCLUDES RESERVATION FEES TICKET CHANGE FEES AND BAGGAGE SERVICE FEES. IT IS UNCLEAR TO US (I) WHY YOU CLASSIFY THESE TYPES OF ANCILLARY FEE REVENUES AS PART OF PASSENGER REVENUES AND (II) THE DISTINCTION YOU MADE IN PRESENTING A DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATION FOR OTHER ANCILLARY REVENUES (E.G. ON-BOARD FOOD AND BEVERAGE SALES COMMISSION INCOME ON SALE OF MILES ETC.) AS OTHER-NET REVENUES IN YOUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. IT APPEARS THE FEES NOTED ABOVE ARE DISTINCT CHARGES FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES SEPARATE FROM THE AIR TRANSPORTATION TRANSACTION. ALSO OTHER AIRLINES IN THE INDUSTRY MAY CLASSIFY THESE ANCILLARY SERVICE REVENUES OUTSIDE OF PASSENGER REVENUES IN A __________________________________________________________________ SEPARATE OTHER OPERATING REVENUE CATEGORY. PLEASE RE-EVALUATE YOUR CLASSIFICATION OF THESE ANCILLARY REVENUES AND CONSIDER WHETHER SEPARATELY CLASSIFYING THEM WITHIN AN OTHER OPERATING REVENUE CATEGORY MAY BE MORE APPROPRIATE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CLASSIFICATION OF REVENUES IS VERY IMPORTANT AND MEANINGFUL AS IT IMPACTS YOUR OPERATING STATISTICS THAT ENABLES AN INVESTOR TO ANALYZE AND COMPARE OPERATING PERFORMANCE MEASURES AMONG DIFFERENT AIRLINE COMPANIES. IN THIS REGARD THE YIELD AND PASSENGER REVENUES PER ASM OPERATING STATISTICS DATA AS PRESENTED IN SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA (ITEM 6) AND MD A -OPERATING STATISTICS SUMMARY (ITEM 7) IS SPECIFICALLY IMPACTED BY THE CLASSIFICATION OF REVENUES. PLEASE ADVISE AND REVISE AS APPROPRIATE. RESPONSE: WE HAVE HISTORICALLY REPORTED BAG SERVICE FEE TICKET CHANGE FEE AND RESERVATION FEE REVENUES WITHIN PASSENGER REVENUE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THESE ITEMS WERE GENERALLY INCLUDED WITH THE PURCHASE OF AIR TRANSPORTATION BEFORE THE INDUSTRY STARTED CHARGING FOR ANCILLARY SERVICES. WE HAVE HOWEVER ANALYZED THE SEC FILINGS OF OUR COMPETITORS AND OTHER TRADE PUBLICATIONS AND CONCLUDED THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE TO RECLASSIFY REVENUE FROM THESE ANCILLARY SERVICES TO OTHER REVENUE SO THAT OUR PASSENGER REVENUES PASSENGER REVENUE PER AVAILABLE SEAT MILE (PRASM) AND YIELD WERE COMPARABLE TO OTHERS IN OUR INDUSTRY AND HELP FACILITATE BETTER ANALYSIS AMONG OUR PEERS. AS STATED IN OUR EARNINGS CALL ON APRIL 19TH WE PLAN TO RECLASSIFY OUR ANCILLARY REVENUES FROM MAINLINE AND REGIONAL PASSENGER REVENUE TO OTHER-NET FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2012. NOTE 1 -GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES REVENUE RECOGNITION PAGE 56 4. WE NOTE FROM YOUR PRESENTATION ON THE FACE OF YOUR BALANCE SHEET THAT YOUR AIR TRAFFIC LIABILITY WAS 489.4 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31 2011. PER YOUR DISCLOSURE HERE THIS ACCOUNT REPRESENTS TICKETS SOLD BUT NOT YET USED UNTIL TRAVEL OR DATE OF EXPIRATION. PLEASE EXPAND YOUR DISCLOSURE EITHER HERE OR IN YOUR DISCUSSION OF CURRENT LIABILITIES IN NOTE 12 ON PAGE 73 TO INDICATE THE PROPORTION OF THIS ACCOUNT ATTRIBUTABLE TO TICKETS SOLD BUT NOT YET USED WHICH ARE PRIOR TO THE ORIGINAL DATE OF TRAVEL AND AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO TRAVEL CREDITS. FURTHER PLEASE PROVIDE YOUR POLICY AS TO THE EXPIRATION OF TRAVEL CREDITS. RESPONSE: AS OF DECEMBER 31 2010 AND DECEMBER 31 2011 THE AMOUNT OF TICKETS SOLD BUT NOT YET USED FOR TRAVEL WAS 401.9 MILLION AND 465.2 MILLION RESPECTIVELY. THE AMOUNT ATTRIBUTABLE TO TRAVEL CREDITS ALL OF WHICH EXPIRE 12 MONTHS FROM DATE OF ISSUANCE WAS 18.5 MILLION AND 21.9 MILLION FOR THE SAME RESPECTIVE PERIODS. THE COMPANY S ACCOUNTING POLICY IS TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR THESE TRAVEL CREDITS WHEN USED OR AT THE DATE OF THE EXPIRATION. IN FUTURE FILINGS THE COMPANY WILL EXPAND ITS ACCOUNTING POLICY FOOTNOTE AND DISCUSSION OF CURRENT LIABILITIES TO CLARIFY WHEN TRAVEL CREDITS EXPIRE AND THE AMOUNT OF THE TRAVEL CREDITS INCLUDED IN AIR TRAFFIC LIABILITY. BELOW IS OUR PROPOSED DISCLOSURE. __________________________________________________________________ FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31 2012 ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES REVENUE RECOGNITION ...AIR TRAFFIC LIABILITY INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY XX MILLION AND 21.9 MILLION RELATED TO TRAVEL CREDITS FOR FUTURE TRAVEL AS OF DECEMBER 31 2012 AND DECEMBER 31 2011 RESPECTIVELY. THESE CREDITS ARE RECOGNIZED INTO REVENUE EITHER WHEN USED OR UPON EXPIRATION WHICH IS 12 MONTHS FROM ISSUANCE. NOTE 7 -INCOME TAXES PAGE 63 5. WE NOTE THAT A SUBSTANTIVE AMOUNT OF YOUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN EACH OF THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS REPRESENT DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE. AS A RESULT DURING THIS THREE YEAR PERIOD YOU DID NOT MATERIALLY INCUR EITHER CURRENT INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR CASH AMOUNTS PAID FOR INCOME TAXES (AS REFLECTED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS). WE ASSUME THIS MAY HAVE OCCURRED PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION METHODS USED FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES THAT HAS GENERATED AN APPROXIMATE 800 MILLION DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY FOR THE EXCESS OF TAX OVER BOOK DEPRECIATION AS REFLECTED IN THE TABLE OF DEFERRED TAX (ASSETS) AND LIABILITIES. IN VIEW OF THIS HIGHLY MATERIAL DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY PLEASE EXPAND THE NOTES TO SPECIFICALLY DISCUSS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR TAX AND BOOK REPORTING FOR DEPRECIATION AND THE PERIODS YOU EXPECT THIS DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY TO REVERSE AND REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN YOUR CURRENT INCOME TAX EXPENSE AS WELL AS A CASH OUTLAY OF CURRENT TAXES PAYABLE. RESPONSE: YOU ARE CORRECT IN YOUR ASSUMPTION THAT ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION HAS CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES OUR AIRCRAFT ARE DEPRECIATED OVER A 15-20 YEAR LIFE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS WITH AN ESTIMATED SALVAGE VALUE. FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES AIRCRAFT ARE GENERALLY DEPRECIATED OVER A SEVEN-YEAR LIFE USING A 200-PERCENT DECLINING BALANCE METHOD WITH NO SALVAGE VALUE. HOWEVER BONUS DEPRECIATION PROVISIONS ARE SOMETIMES AVAILABLE UNDER APPLICABLE TAX LAWS WHICH ALLOW FOR EVEN MORE ACCELERATED DEDUCTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE IN 2011 THE COMPANY USED 100-PERCENT BONUS DEPRECIATION FOR PURCHASED AIRCRAFT. AT DECEMBER 31 2011 OUR DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY RELATED TO EXCESS TAX DEPRECIATION WAS 795 MILLION. ABSENT ANY FUTURE ASSET PURCHASES THIS DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY WOULD APPROXIMATELY REVERSE AS FOLLOWS: 0-5 YEARS 130 MILLION 6-10 YEARS 280 MILLION AFTER 10 YEARS 385 MILLION FOR THE STAFF S INFORMATION THE INCREASE IN REVERSALS IN THE 6-10 YEAR PERIOD IS DUE TO SOME OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS BEING FULLY DEPRECIATED UNDER MACRS FOR TAX PURPOSES. THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE RELATED TO THE SALVAGE VALUE REMAINING FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING WILL NOT REVERSE UNTIL THE AIRCRAFT IS SOLD OR THERE IS A CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OF SALVAGE VALUE. __________________________________________________________________ IN FUTURE FILINGS WE WILL DISCLOSE THE FOLLOWING: FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30 2012 PART I. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ITEM 1. NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) NOTE 8. INCOME TAXES ...PRIMARILY DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN DEPRECIATION RATES FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES AND FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES THE COMPANY HAS GENERATED A NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY. 6. IN ADDITION IN YOUR MD A ANALYSIS OF CASH FLOWS AND LIQUIDITY PLEASE INFORM READERS AS TO THE REASONABLE LIKELINESS OF AN EXPOSURE TO A MATERIAL FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS KNOWN EVENT. PLEASE REFER TO THE GUIDANCE IN ITEM 303(A)(1) OF REGULATION S-K AND SECTION 501.13 IN THE CODIFICATION OF FINANCIAL REPORTING RELEASES. PLEASE REVISE ACCORDINGLY. RESPONSE: THE PRIMARY ASSETS WHICH ARE GENERATING THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES ARE OUR AIRCRAFT. AS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1 OF OUR FORM 10-K THESE ASSETS ARE DEPRECIATED OVER 15 TO 20 YEARS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES BUT FOR TAX PURPOSES ARE DEPRECIATED USING ACCELERATED METHODS. AS DISCLOSED UNDER OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS IN MD A WE WILL CONTINUE TO GROW OUR FLEET WITH PURCHASED AIRCRAFT AND ACCORDINGLY WE EXPECT OUR DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY TO CONTINUE TO GROW BUT DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES CANNOT ESTIMATE A FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENT BASED ON THE REVERSAL OF THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY. IN FUTURE FILINGS WE WILL DISCLOSE THE FOLLOWING: ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ...FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES THE MAJORITY OF OUR ASSETS ARE DEPRECIATED OVER A SEVEN-YEAR LIFE USING AN ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION METHOD. FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES THE MAJORITY OF OUR ASSETS ARE DEPRECIATED OVER 15-20 YEARS TO AN ESTIMATED SALVAGE VALUE USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. THIS DIFFERENCE HAS CREATED A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY. AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE THE DEPRECIATION BASIS WILL REVERSE RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN INCOME TAXES PAID. WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD HAVE MATERIAL CASH OBLIGATIONS FOR THIS DEFERRED LIABILITY AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE WE CANNOT ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF THE CASH FLOWS WITH REASONABLE ACCURACY. TAXABLE INCOME AND CASH TAXES PAYABLE ARE IMPACTED BY MANY ITEMS INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF BOOK INCOME GENERATED LEVEL OF PENSION FUNDING (WHICH IS GENERALLY NOT KNOWN UNTIL LATE EACH YEAR) WHETHER BONUS DEPRECIATION PROVISIONS ARE AVAILABLE AS WELL AS OTHER LEGISLATIVE CHANGES THAT ARE OUT OF OUR CONTROL. __________________________________________________________________ IN CONNECTION WITH OUR RESPONSES WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT: O THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADEQUACY AND ACCURACY OF THE DISCLOSURE IN THE FILING O STAFF COMMENTS OR CHANGES TO DISCLOSURE IN RESPONSE TO STAFF COMMENTS DO NOT FORECLOSE THE COMMISSION FROM TAKING ANY ACTION WITH RESPECT TO THE FILING AND O THE COMPANY MAY NOT ASSERT STAFF COMMENTS AS A DEFENSE IN ANY PROCEEDING INITIATED BY THE COMMISSION OR ANY PERSON UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES.
