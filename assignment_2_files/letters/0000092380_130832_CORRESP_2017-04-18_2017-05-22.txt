SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION APRIL 18 2017 PAGE 1 APRIL 18 2017 VIA EDGAR DIVISION OF CORPORATION FINANCE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION 100 F STREET NE WASHINGTON D.C. 20549-3561 ATTENTION: LYN SHENK BRANCH CHIEF RE: SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO. FORM 10-K FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2016 FILED ON FEBRUARY 7 2017 FILE NO. 001-07259 DEAR MR. SHENK: ON BEHALF OF SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO. (THE COMPANY ) SET FORTH BELOW ARE THE COMPANY S RESPONSES TO THE COMMENTS OF THE STAFF (THE STAFF ) OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE COMMISSION ) IN ITS LETTER DATED APRIL 6 2017 WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY S FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2016 (THE FORM 10-K ). FOR EASE OF REFERENCE WE HAVE REPRODUCED BELOW THE FULL TEXT OF THE STAFF S COMMENTS EACH OF WHICH IS FOLLOWED BY THE COMPANY S RESPONSE. FORM 10-K FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2016 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS NON-GAAP MEASURES RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL PAGE 47 1. PLEASE PRESENT THE COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE WITH EQUAL OR GREATER PROMINENCE AND LABEL THE NON-GAAP CALCULATION AS ADJUSTED OR SIMILAR. REFER TO ITEM10(E)(1)(I)(A) AND QUESTION 102.10 OF STAFF S COMPLIANCE AND DISCUSSION INTERPRETATION ON NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES FOR GUIDANCE. RESPONSE: THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS COMPLIED WITH ITEM10(E)(1)(I)(A) AND QUESTION 102.10 OF STAFF S COMPLIANCE AND DISCUSSION INTERPRETATION ON NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN ITS PRESENTATION OF ROIC. ROIC ITSELF IS NOT DEFINED BY GAAP BUT IS A FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT CAN BE USEFUL TO INVESTORS AS A SUPPLEMENT TO OTHER MEASURES. THE COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IN THE CALCULATION OF ROIC IT DOES UTILIZE NON-GAAP INFORMATION AND THAT IS WHY THE COMPANY PROVIDES A RECONCILIATION OF THAT INFORMATION TO THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. HOWEVER THE COMPANY DOES BELIEVE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO CLARIFY AND IMPROVE THE RECONCILIATION AND EXPLANATIONS PROVIDED. SET FORTH BELOW IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE COMPANY PROPOSES TO ENHANCE ITS FUTURE DISCLOSURES RELATED TO ROIC BEGINNING WITH ITS FIRST QUARTER 2017 RESULTS THAT ARE PLANNED FOR RELEASE ON APRIL 27 2017. FOR THE STAFF S CONVENIENCE WE HAVE MARKED THE CHANGES COMPARED TO THE DISCLOSURES COMMENTED __________________________________________________________________ SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION APRIL 18 2017 PAGE 2 ON BY THE STAFF. THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS FUTURE DISCLOSURES WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY IN THIS PROPOSED FORM WITH APPROPRIATE CHANGES DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR NON-GAAP INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE PERIODIC REPORT. NON-GAAP RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) (IN MILLIONS) (UNAUDITED) YEAR ENDED YEAR ENDED YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2016 DECEMBER 31 2015 DECEMBER 31 2014 OPERATING INCOME AS REPORTED 3 760 4 116 2 225 SPECIAL REVENUE ADJUSTMENT (1) --(172 ) --UNION CONTRACT BONUSES 356 334 9 NET IMPACT FROM FUEL CONTRACTS (202 ) (323 ) 28 ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION COSTS --39 126 LITIGATION SETTLEMENT --(37 ) --ASSET IMPAIRMENT 21 ----LEASE TERMINATION EXPENSE 22 ----OPERATING INCOME NON-GAAP 3 957 3 957 2 388 NET ADJUSTMENT FOR AIRCRAFT LEASES (2) 111 114 133 ADJUSTMENT FOR FUEL HEDGE ACCOUNTING (3) (152 ) (124 ) (62 ) ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME NON-GAAP 3 916 3 947 2 459 DEBT INCLUDING CAPITAL LEASES (4) 3 304 2 782 2 763 EQUITY (4) 7 833 7 032 7 249 NET PRESENT VALUE OF AIRCRAFT OPERATING LEASES (4) 1 015 1 223 1 458 AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL 12 152 11 037 11 470 EQUITY ADJUSTMENT FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING (3) 886 1 027 104 ADJUSTED AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL 13 038 12 064 11 574 NON-GAAP ROIC PRE-TAX 30.0 32.7 21.2 (1) ONE-TIME ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO THE EXECUTION OF THE AGREEMENT WITH CHASE AND THE RESULTING CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING METHODOLOGY. SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. (2) NET ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO PRESUMPTION THAT ALL AIRCRAFT IN FLEET ARE OWNED (I.E. THE IMPACT OF ELIMINATING AIRCRAFT RENT EXPENSE AND REPLACING WITH ESTIMATED DEPRECIATION EXPENSE FOR THOSE SAME AIRCRAFT). THE COMPANY MAKES THIS ADJUSTMENT TO ENHANCE COMPARABILITY TO OTHER ENTITIES THAT HAVE DIFFERENT CAPITAL STRUCTURES BY UTILIZING ALTERNATIVE FINANCING DECISIONS. (3) THE ADJUSTMENT FOR FUEL HEDGE ACCOUNTING IN THE NUMERATOR IS DUE TO THE COMPANY S ACCOUNTING POLICY DECISION TO CLASSIFY FUEL HEDGE ACCOUNTING PREMIUMS BELOW THE OPERATING INCOME LINE AND THUS IS ADJUSTING OPERATING INCOME TO REFLECT SUCH POLICY DECISION. THE EQUITY ADJUSTMENT FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING IN THE DENOMINATOR ADJUSTS FOR THE CUMULATIVE IMPACTS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND __________________________________________________________________ SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION APRIL 18 2017 PAGE 3 RETAINED EARNINGS OF GAINS AND/OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH HEDGE ACCOUNTING RELATED TO FUEL HEDGE DERIVATIVES THAT WILL SETTLE IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE CURRENT PERIOD IMPACT OF THESE GAINS AND/OR LOSSES ARE REFLECTED IN THE NET IMPACT FROM FUEL CONTRACTS IN THE NUMERATOR. (4) CALCULATED AS AN AVERAGE OF THE FIVE MOST RECENT QUARTER END BALANCES OR REMAINING OBLIGATIONS. THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF AIRCRAFT OPERATING LEASES REPRESENTS THE ASSUMPTION THAT ALL AIRCRAFT IN THE COMPANY S FLEET ARE OWNED AS IT REFLECTS THE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS DISCOUNTED AT ITS ESTIMATED INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE AS OF THE TIME EACH INDIVIDUAL LEASE WAS SIGNED. NOTE REGARDING USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THE COMPANY S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES ( GAAP ). THESE GAAP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE (I) UNREALIZED NON-CASH ADJUSTMENTS AND RECLASSIFICATIONS WHICH CAN BE SIGNIFICANT AS A RESULT OF ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS AND ELECTIONS MADE UNDER ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS RELATING TO DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING AND (II) OTHER CHARGES AND BENEFITS THE COMPANY BELIEVES ARE UNUSUAL AND/OR INFREQUENT IN NATURE AND THUS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF ITS ONGOING OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE. AS A RESULT THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES FINANCIAL INFORMATION IN THIS FILING THAT WAS NOT PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE INFORMATION PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE COMPANY PROVIDES SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDING RESULTS THAT IT REFERS TO AS ECONOMIC WHICH THE COMPANY S MANAGEMENT UTILIZES TO EVALUATE ITS ONGOING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND THE COMPANY BELIEVES PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INSIGHT TO INVESTORS AS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO ITS GAAP RESULTS. THE NON-GAAP MEASURES PROVIDED THAT RELATE TO THE COMPANY S PERFORMANCE ON AN ECONOMIC FUEL COST BASIS INCLUDE FUEL AND OIL EXPENSE NON-GAAP TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES NON-GAAP OPERATING INCOME NON-GAAP NET INCOME NON-GAAP AND NET INCOME PER SHARE DILUTED NON-GAAP. THE COMPANY S ECONOMIC FUEL AND OIL EXPENSE RESULTS DIFFER FROM GAAP RESULTS IN THAT THEY ONLY INCLUDE THE ACTUAL CASH SETTLEMENTS FROM FUEL HEDGE CONTRACTS -ALL REFLECTED WITHIN FUEL AND OIL EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD OF SETTLEMENT. THUS FUEL AND OIL EXPENSE ON AN ECONOMIC BASIS HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY AS WELL AS SOME OF THE OTHER AIRLINES THAT UTILIZE FUEL HEDGING AS IT REFLECTS THE COMPANY S ACTUAL NET CASH OUTLAYS FOR FUEL DURING THE APPLICABLE PERIOD INCLUSIVE OF SETTLED FUEL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. ANY NET PREMIUM COSTS PAID RELATED TO OPTION CONTRACTS ARE REFLECTED AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER (GAINS) LOSSES NET FOR BOTH GAAP AND NON-GAAP (INCLUDING ECONOMIC) PURPOSES IN THE PERIOD OF CONTRACT SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THESE ECONOMIC RESULTS PROVIDE A BETTER MEASURE OF THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY S FUEL HEDGES ON ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND LIQUIDITY SINCE THEY EXCLUDE THE UNREALIZED NON-CASH ADJUSTMENTS AND RECLASSIFICATIONS THAT __________________________________________________________________ SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION APRIL 18 2017 PAGE 4 ARE RECORDED IN GAAP RESULTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATING TO DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THEY REFLECT ALL CASH SETTLEMENTS RELATED TO FUEL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WITHIN FUEL AND OIL EXPENSE. THIS ENABLES THE COMPANY S MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO CONSISTENTLY ASSESS THE COMPANY S OPERATING PERFORMANCE ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR OR QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER BASIS AFTER CONSIDERING ALL EFFORTS IN PLACE TO MANAGE FUEL EXPENSE. HOWEVER BECAUSE THESE MEASURES ARE NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP SUCH MEASURES ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS AND NOT ALL COMPANIES CALCULATE THE MEASURES IN THE SAME MANNER. AS A RESULT THE AFOREMENTIONED MEASURES AS PRESENTED MAY NOT BE DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. FURTHER INFORMATION ON (I) THE COMPANY S FUEL HEDGING PROGRAM (II) THE REQUIREMENTS OF ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND (III) THE CAUSES OF HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS AND/OR MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS OR LOSSES FROM DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN ADDITION THE COMPANY S GAAP RESULTS IN THE APPLICABLE PERIODS INCLUDE OTHER CHARGES OR BENEFITS THAT ARE DEEMED SPECIAL ITEMS THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS AND MAKE ITS RESULTS DIFFICULT TO COMPARE TO PRIOR PERIODS ANTICIPATED FUTURE PERIODS OR TO ITS COMPETITORS RESULTS. FINANCIAL MEASURES IDENTIFIED AS NON-GAAP (OR AS EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS) HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE SPECIAL ITEMS. SPECIAL ITEMS INCLUDE: 1. A ONE-TIME 172 MILLION SPECIAL REVENUE ADJUSTMENT IN JULY 2015 AS A RESULT OF THE AGREEMENT WITH CHASE AND THE RESULTING REQUIRED CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING METHODOLOGY. THIS INCREASE TO REVENUE REPRESENTED A NONRECURRING REQUIRED ACCELERATION OF REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE 2009-13 2. UNION CONTRACT BONUSES RECORDED FOR CERTAIN WORKGROUPS. AS THE BONUSES WOULD ONLY BE PAID AT RATIFICATION OF THE ASSOCIATED TENTATIVE AGREEMENT AND WOULD NOT REPRESENT AN ONGOING EXPENSE TO THE COMPANY MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ITS RESULTS FOR THE ASSOCIATED PERIODS ARE MORE USEFULLY COMPARED IF THE IMPACTS OF RATIFICATION BONUS AMOUNTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM RESULTS. GENERALLY UNION CONTRACT AGREEMENTS COVER A SPECIFIED THREE-TO FIVE-YEAR PERIOD ALTHOUGH SUCH CONTRACTS OFFICIALLY NEVER EXPIRE AND THE AGREED UPON TERMS REMAIN IN PLACE UNTIL A REVISED AGREEMENT IS REACHED WHICH CAN BE SEVERAL YEARS FOLLOWING THE AMENDABLE DATE 3. EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY S ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION OF AIRTRAN. SUCH EXPENSES WERE PRIMARILY INCURRED DURING THE ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION PERIOD OF THE TWO COMPANIES FROM 2011 THROUGH 2015 AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY S ACQUISITION OF AIRTRAN WHICH CLOSED ON MAY 2 2011. THE __________________________________________________________________ SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION APRIL 18 2017 PAGE 5 EXCLUSION OF THESE EXPENSES PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH A MORE APPLICABLE BASIS WITH WHICH TO COMPARE RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS NOW THAT THE INTEGRATION PROCESS HAS BEEN COMPLETED 4. A GAIN RESULTING FROM A LITIGATION SETTLEMENT RECEIVED IN JANUARY 2015. THIS CASH SETTLEMENT MEANINGFULLY LOWERED OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES DURING THE APPLICABLE PERIOD AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT A SIMILAR IMPACT ON ITS COST STRUCTURE IN THE FUTURE 5. A NONCASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO LEASED SLOTS AT NEWARK LIBERTY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AS A RESULT OF THE FAA ANNOUNCEMENT IN APRIL 2016 THAT THIS AIRPORT WAS BEING CHANGED TO A LEVEL 2 SCHEDULE-FACILITATED AIRPORT FROM ITS PREVIOUS DESIGNATION AS LEVEL 3 AND 6. LEASE TERMINATION COSTS RECORDED DURING 2016 AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY ACQUIRING FIVE OF ITS BOEING 737-300 AIRCRAFT OFF OPERATING LEASES AS PART OF THE COMPANY S STRATEGIC EFFORT TO PHASE OUT ITS CLASSIC AIRCRAFT FROM OPERATIONS BY THE END OF THIRD QUARTER 2017 IN THE MOST ECONOMICALLY ADVANTAGEOUS MANNER POSSIBLE. THE COMPANY HAD NOT BUDGETED FOR THESE EARLY LEASE TERMINATION COSTS AS THEY WERE SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATIONS BEING CONCLUDED WITH THE THIRD PARTY LESSORS. THE COMPANY RECORDED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AIRCRAFT AS WELL AS ANY ASSOCIATED REMAINING OBLIGATIONS TO THE BALANCE SHEET AS DEBT. BECAUSE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES EACH OF THESE ITEMS CAN DISTORT THE TRENDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY S ONGOING PERFORMANCE AS AN AIRLINE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT EVALUATION OF ITS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CAN BE ENHANCED BY A SUPPLEMENTAL PRESENTATION OF RESULTS THAT EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF THESE ITEMS IN ORDER TO ENHANCE CONSISTENCY AND COMPARATIVENESS WITH RESULTS IN PRIOR PERIODS THAT DO NOT INCLUDE SUCH ITEMS AND AS A BASIS FOR EVALUATING OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE FOLLOWING MEASURES ARE OFTEN PROVIDED EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS AND UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY S MANAGEMENT ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS TO ENHANCE COMPARABILITY OF YEAR-OVER-YEAR RESULTS AS WELL AS TO COMPARE RESULTS TO OTHER AIRLINES: OPERATING REVENUES NON-GAAP TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES NON-GAAP OPERATING INCOME NON-GAAP NET INCOME NON-GAAP NET INCOME PER SHARE DILUTED NON-GAAP AND OPERATING EXPENSES PER ASM NON-GAAP EXCLUDING FUEL AND SPECIAL ITEMS. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO PROVIDED ITS CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL WHICH IS A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE USED BY MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE ITS INVESTMENT RETURNS ON CAPITAL. RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR FINANCIAL RESULTS AS REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE UTILIZED IN PLACE OF SUCH GAAP RESULTS. ALTHOUGH RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL IS NOT A MEASURE DEFINED BY GAAP IT IS CALCULATED BY THE COMPANY IN PART USING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. THOSE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE UTILIZED FOR THE SAME REASONS AS THOSE NOTED ABOVE FOR NET INCOME NON-GAAP AND OPERATING INCOME NON-GAAP-THE COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURES INCLUDE CHARGES OR BENEFITS THAT ARE DEEMED SPECIAL __________________________________________________________________ SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION APRIL 18 2017 PAGE 6 ITEMS THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS AND MAKE ITS RESULTS DIFFICULT TO COMPARE TO PRIOR PERIODS ANTICIPATED FUTURE PERIODS OR TO ITS COMPETITORS RESULTS AND THE COMPANY S PROFITABILITY TARGETS AND ESTIMATES BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY ARE BASED ON NON-GAAP RESULTS SINCE IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES THE SPECIAL ITEMS CANNOT BE RELIABLY PREDICTED OR ESTIMATED. THE COMPANY BELIEVES NON-GAAP RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL IS A MEANINGFUL MEASURE BECAUSE IT QUANTIFIES HOW WELL THE COMPANY S EFFECTIVENESS IN GENERATING RETURNS ES OPERATING INCOME RELATIVE TO THE CAPITAL IT HAS INVESTED IN ITS BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL IS COMMONLY USED AS A MEASURE OF CAPITAL EFFICIENCY DEFINITIONS OF RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL DIFFER THEREFORE THE COMPANY IS PROVIDING AN EXPLANATION OF ITS CALCULATION FOR NON-GAAP RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (BEFORE TAXES AND EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS) IN THE ACCOMPANYING RECONCILIATION IN ORDER TO ALLOW INVESTORS TO COMPARE AND CONTRAST ITS CALCULATION TO THOSE PROVIDED BY OTHER COMPANIES. 2. WE NOTE YOU ADJUST OPERATING INCOME USED IN YOUR CALCULATION OF ROIC FOR NET ADJUSTMENT FOR AIRCRAFT LEASES. YOU DEFINE THIS ADJUSTMENT AS THE PRESUMPTION THAT ALL AIRCRAFT IN YOUR FLEET ARE OWNED WITH THE IMPACT OF ELIMINATING AIRCRAFT RENT EXPENSE AND REPLACING IT WITH ESTIMATED DEPRECIATION EXPENSE FOR THE SAME AIRCRAFT. PLEASE TELL US WHETHER AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL HAS BEEN ADJUSTED FOR ANY IMPACT ON YOUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH MAKING THIS ADJUSTMENT AND WHAT THE IMPACT IS INCLUDING WHY YOUR TREATMENT IS MEANINGFUL TO INVESTORS. FOR EXAMPLE TELL US IF ANOTHER TYPE OF FINANCING IS ASSUMED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE PRESUMPTION THE AIRCRAFT IS OWNED AND THE BASIS FOR YOUR ASSUMPTION. RESPONSE: THE COMPANY S CALCULATION OF AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL DOES INCLUDE AN ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO THE PRESUMPTION THAT ALL AIRCRAFT IN THE FLEET ARE OWNED IN ORDER TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME NON-GAAP. THE COMPANY MAKES THIS PRESUMPTION DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE WITHIN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS TO OTHER INDUSTRIES TO WHICH IT COULD BE COMPARED. AS DENOTED IN THE FOOTNOTES TO THE ROIC CALCULATION THE COMPANY DETERMINES AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL BY ADDING 1) DEBT REFLECTED ON THE COMPANY S BALANCE SHEET (WHICH IS INCLUSIVE OF CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS) 2) TOTAL SHAREHOLDER S EQUITY AND 3) THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF AIRCRAFT LEASES. THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF AIRCRAFT LEASES RELATES TO OPERATING LEASES THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY REFLECTED ON THE COMPANY S BALANCE SHEET AND THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT AMOUNT APPROXIMATES THE PRICE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PAID TO PURCHASE THE AIRCRAFT SINCE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE OPERATING LEASES ARE LONG-TERM IN NATURE. 3. FOOTNOTE (3) TO THE COMPUTATION OF ROIC STATES THE AMOUNT OF AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCLUDES THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF AIRCRAFT LEASES. PLEASE TELL US IF THIS REPRESENTS THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF ALL LEASES (WHETHER OPERATING OR CAPITAL) OR JUST CAPITAL LEASES AND WHY YOUR TREATMENT IS MEANINGFUL TO INVESTORS. RESPONSE: THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS ADDRESSED THIS COMMENT IN THE RESPONSE TO 1. AND 2. ABOVE. __________________________________________________________________ SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION APRIL 18 2017 PAGE 7 4. IT APPEARS YOUR DESCRIPTION ON PAGE 49 WHY RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL IS A MEANINGFUL MEASURE REFERS TO THE MEASURE AS CALCULATED ON A GAAP BASIS. PLEASE INCLUDE A DESCRIPTION OF WHY YOUR CALCULATION OF ROIC ON A NON-GAAP BASIS IS MEANINGFUL TO INVESTORS. ADDITIONALLY CLARIFY FOR INVESTORS THE DIFFERENCE IN USEFULNESS BETWEEN THE TWO. RESPONSE: THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS ADDRESSED THIS COMMENT IN THE RESPONSE TO 1. ABOVE. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES PAGE 49 5. WE NOTE THE WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT FOR EACH YEAR REPORTED ON THE BALANCE SHEET. PLEASE DISCUSS (I) THE REASON FOR THE DEFICIT (II) ITS EFFECT ON YOUR LIQUIDITY AND OPERATIONS AND (III) HOW YOU MANAGE THE DEFICIT. REFER TO ITEM 303(A)(1) OF REGULATION S-K AND INSTRUCTION 5 TO INSTRUCTIONS TO PARAGRAPH 303(A) FOR GUIDANCE. RESPONSE: THE COMPANY ROUTINELY CARRIES A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AS DO THE MAJORITY OF MAJOR U.S. AIRLINES PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY S LARGEST CURRENT OBLIGATION IS AIR TRAFFIC LIABILITY WHICH IS A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION FOR FUTURE CUSTOMER FLIGHTS IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID. UNLIKE THE COMPANY S OTHER CURRENT OBLIGATIONS IT DOES NOT REQUIRE FUTURE SETTLEMENT IN CASH AND IS MOSTLY NONREFUNDABLE. ANOTHER FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE COMPANY S WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT IN RECENT YEARS IS THE COMPANY S ACCOUNTING POLICY REGARDING OFFSETTING FOR CASH COLLATERAL PROVIDED TO FUEL HEDGE COUNTERPARTIES AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT THROUGH A COMBINATION OF A FOCUS ON ITS INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING A STRONG OVERALL BALANCE SHEET MODEST DEBT LEVELS CONSERVATIVE GROWTH TARGETS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF A 1 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT CAN BE DRAWN UPON IF NEEDED (WHICH CAN BE INCREASED UP TO 1.5 BILLION IF NEEDED THROUGH AN ACCORDION FEATURE). THE COMPANY STRONGLY BELIEVES ITS WORKING CAPITAL POSITION AND STRATEGY IS MANAGEABLE AND HAS NOT CREATED ANY UNDUE HARDSHIPS IN THE PAST. THE COMPANY WILL CONSIDER SUPPLEMENTING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED AND DISCLOSURES MADE IN FUTURE FILINGS TO ADDRESS THE STAFF S COMMENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE.
