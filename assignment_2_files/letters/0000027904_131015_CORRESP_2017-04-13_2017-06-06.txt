DELTA HAD NO REVENUE RELATED TO SYRIA IN ANY OF THE YEARS IN THE REFERENCED PERIOD. THE INTERLINE SALES COMMISSION REVENUE SHOWN IN THE CHART IN THE RESPONSE TO COMMENT NO. 1 ABOVE WAS COMPLETELY IMMATERIAL TO INVESTORS IN LIGHT OF DELTA S TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE REFERENCED PERIOD. DELTA HAS NO ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARISING FROM EITHER SUDAN OR SYRIA. TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF DELTA S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER AND CORPORATE SECRETARY AND VICE PRESIDENT-INVESTOR RELATIONS DELTA HAS NOT RECEIVED ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM INVESTORS OR SECURITIES ANALYSTS REGARDING DELTA S CONTACTS WITH SUDAN OR SYRIA. LIKEWISE DELTA DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS IMMATERIAL CONTACTS WITH SUDAN WILL CAUSE IT TO BE A TARGET OF GROUPS WITH DIVESTMENT OR SIMILAR INITIATIVES. AS A RESULT DELTA BELIEVES ITS IMMATERIAL CONTACTS WITH SUDAN DO NOT CONSTITUTE A FACTOR A REASONABLE INVESTOR WOULD DEEM IMPORTANT IN MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION. U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION APRIL 13 2017 PAGE 5 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION PAGE 47 3. WE NOTE THAT IN YOUR CALCULATION OF ROIC AND ADJUSTED NET DEBT THAT YOU UTILIZE AN ASSUMPTION OF SEVEN TIMES THE AMOUNT OF AIRCRAFT RENT FOR THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS. PLEASE CLARIFY THE BASIS FOR THE ASSUMPTION AND TELL US HOW IT COMPARES TO YOUR CONTRACTUAL LEASE TERMS. IF IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT PLEASE CLARIFY WHY IT WOULD BE MEANINGFUL TO AN INVESTOR IF IT DOES NOT DEPICT A REALISTIC PICTURE OF YOUR FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. OUR COMMENT ALSO APPLIES TO ADJUSTED NET DEBT DISCLOSED IN YOUR FORM 8-K FURNISHED ON JANUARY 12 2017. RESPONSE: DELTA UTILIZES AN ASSUMPTION OF SEVEN TIMES THE AMOUNT OF AIRCRAFT RENT FOR THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS IN ITS CALCULATIONS OF ROIC AND ADJUSTED NET DEBT TO ENABLE INVESTORS TO BETTER COMPARE ITS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE USE OF CAPITAL AND INDEBTEDNESS TO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY AND OTHER HIGH-QUALITY INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES. IT IS COMMON FOR BOTH INVESTORS AND CREDIT RATING AGENCIES TO USE A MULTIPLE OF RENT EXPENSE INCURRED FOR AIRCRAFT UNDER OPERATING LEASES TO ESTIMATE THE DEBT AN AIRLINE WOULD RECORD IF ITS AIRCRAFT LEASES MET THE CAPITAL LEASE CRITERIA OR THE AIRCRAFT WERE OWNED. (SIMILAR MULTIPLES ARE USED IN OTHER INDUSTRIES FOR THE OPERATING LEASES PERTINENT TO THEIR OPERATIONS.) USING A MULTIPLE OF RENT EXPENSE PROVIDES A MEANINGFUL COMPARISON TO OTHER COMPANIES WHO HAVE DIFFERENT DEBT STRUCTURES AND FLEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. DELTA HAS APPLIED THE SEVEN TIMES MULTIPLE CONSISTENTLY SINCE IT BEGAN PRESENTING THESE METRICS. THE ASSUMPTION IS A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF THE AVERAGE REMAINING TERM OF THE AIRCRAFT OPERATING LEASES AS WELL AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE FUTURE PAYMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31 2016 DELTA OPERATED 832 AIRCRAFT WITH 127 AIRCRAFT UNDER OPERATING LEASES REPRESENTING 15 OF THE FLEET. OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS THE AVERAGE REMAINING TERM FOR AIRCRAFT UNDER OPERATING LEASES RANGED FROM 8-10 YEARS. AT DECEMBER 31 2016 THE PRESENT VALUE OF DELTA S FUTURE MINIMUM AIRCRAFT LEASE PAYMENTS DISCOUNTED BY THE COMPANY S INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE WAS 2.2 BILLION. FOR COMPARISON THE ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT CALCULATED USING SEVEN TIMES AIRCRAFT RENT WITHIN ADJUSTED NET DEBT IN DELTA S 2016 FORM 10-K WAS 2.0 BILLION. THE 200 MILLION DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO ESTIMATED AMOUNTS IS NOT QUANTITATIVELY OR QUALITATIVELY MATERIAL IN THE CALCULATION OF THE 6.1 BILLION ADJUSTED NET DEBT BALANCE. IN THE CALCULATION OF ROIC DELTA USED THE SEVEN TIMES AIRCRAFT RENT ASSUMPTION TO APPROXIMATE INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE LEASE OBLIGATION. BY USING THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS OF 2.2 BILLION THE CALCULATION DERIVES AN INTEREST EXPENSE AMOUNT THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ADJUSTMENT WITHIN THE ROIC METRIC. DELTA BELIEVES THE ASSUMPTION OF SEVEN TIMES AIRCRAFT RENT IS A REALISTIC DEPICTION TO ADJUST BOTH METRICS IT IS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED AND IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD BY THE USERS OF DELTA S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION APRIL 13 2017 PAGE 6 WE SINCERELY HOPE THAT WE HAVE THOROUGHLY ADDRESSED YOUR COMMENTS ON OUR 2016 FORM 10-K FILED FEBRUARY 13 2017 AND FORM 8-K FILED JANUARY 12 2017. WE WILL BE PLEASED TO RESPOND PROMPTLY TO ANY ADDITIONAL REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION OR MATERIAL THAT WE MAY PROVIDE IN ORDER TO FACILITATE YOUR REVIEW.
