DELTA SUSPENDED THE SALE OF TICKETS CONTAINING SYRIA FLIGHT SEGMENTS IN DELTA S RESERVATIONS SYSTEM AND ISSUED INSTRUCTIONS TO GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS SUCH AS SABRE TO DISCONTINUE THE SALE OF INTERLINE TICKETS ON THIRD-PARTY CARRIERS CONTAINING SYRIA FLIGHT SEGMENTS. DELTA TOOK SUCH ACTIONS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS OFAC ISSUED ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND ITS IMPACT UPON BOOKING TRAVEL TO OR FROM SYRIA ON FLIGHTS OPERATED BY NON-SYRIAN CARRIERS. OFAC HAS SINCE CONFIRMED THAT TRAVEL AND THE FACILITATION OF TRAVEL IS ALLOWED UNDER THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND DELTA WILL BE TAKING STEPS SHORTLY TO RESUME TRAVEL SALES TO/FROM SYRIA (PROVIDED THAT SUCH TRAVEL IS NOT ON A SYRIAN CARRIER). __________________________________________________________________ PAGE 4 U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOVEMBER 4 2011 PLANNED PASSENGER CHARTER OPERATIONS TO CUBA AS NOTED IN COMMENT NO. 1 OF THE STAFF S AUGUST 9 2011 LETTER DELTA HOLDS A CARRIER SERVICE PROVIDER LICENSE ( CSP LICENSE ) THAT AUTHORIZES DELTA TO OPERATE PASSENGER CHARTER SERVICE TO AND FROM CUBA CONSISTENT WITH AND SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS OF THE CACR AND OFAC GUIDELINES. DELTA ALSO HOLDS A SAFETY AND SECURITY TRAVEL LICENSE ISSUED BY OFAC ( OFAC SECURITY LICENSE ) THAT AUTHORIZES SPECIFIED DELTA PERSONNEL TO TRAVEL TO CUBA TO CONDUCT INSPECTIONS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF PASSENGERS AND AIRCRAFT. IN MID-2011 DELTA ENTERED INTO A CHARTER AGREEMENT WITH MARAZUL CHARTERS INC. ( MARAZUL ) AN OFAC-LICENSED CARRIER SERVICE PROVIDER TRAVEL SERVICE PROVIDER AND REMITTANCE FORWARDER. PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT MARAZUL LAWFULLY CHARTERS FROM DELTA AIRCRAFT AND CREW FOR MARAZUL S CUBA PASSENGER CHARTER PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS INVOLVE PASSENGER CHARTER AIR TRANSPORTATION ON THE FOLLOWING ROUTES FOR WHICH MARAZUL HOLDS U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION APPROVAL: MIAMI TO/FROM HAVANA (EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1 2011) NEW YORK JFK TO/FROM HAVANA (EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 1 2011) AND ATLANTA TO/FROM HAVANA (EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1 2011). MARAZUL MANAGES ALL ASPECTS OF THE CHARTER PROGRAMS UNDER ITS OWN OFAC CARRIER SERVICE PROVIDER LICENSE INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO APPLYING FOR LANDING RIGHTS AND FLIGHT CLEARANCES FROM AND MAKING GROUND HANDLING TICKETING SCREENING AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT. MARAZUL MAKES ANY REQUIRED PAYMENTS TO THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT FOR THESE ARRANGEMENTS.

DELTA S ROLE IS LIMITED TO THE OPERATION OF PASSENGER AIRCRAFT AND THE PROVISION OF CREW. DELTA DOES NOT PROVIDE CARGO TRANSPORTATION SERVICES TO CUBA PURSUANT TO THE CHARTER AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER ARRANGEMENT. UNDER THE CHARTER AGREEMENT DELTA IS PAID A FLAT FEE PER FLIGHT. DELTA DOES NOT OFFER TICKETS FOR SALE TO PASSENGERS. THE CHARTER AGREEMENT TERMINATES ON JANUARY 31 2012 AND IS SUBJECT TO RENEWAL BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT. DELTA BELIEVES THE AMOUNTS TO BE PAID BY MARAZUL TO DELTA IN 2011 AND 2012 WILL NOT BE MATERIAL TO DELTA S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR EITHER OF THOSE YEARS. __________________________________________________________________ PAGE 5 U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOVEMBER 4 2011 ON TWO OCCASIONS IN 2011 PURSUANT TO ITS OFAC SECURITY LICENSE DELTA SENT REPRESENTATIVES TO CUBA TO CONDUCT SAFETY AND SECURITY INSPECTIONS AT LOCAL AIRPORT FACILITIES AS REQUIRED BY DELTA S CONTRACT WITH MARAZUL. DURING THESE LICENSED VISITS MARAZUL PAID THE LODGING MEAL AND GROUND TRANSPORTATION EXPENSES OF DELTA S SAFETY INSPECTORS. CODESHARE AND INTERLINE AGREEMENTS DELTA IS A PARTY TO CODESHARE AND INTERLINE AGREEMENTS WITH MANY FOREIGN AIR CARRIERS AS DESCRIBED BELOW. CODESHARE AGREEMENTS ARE COMMON IN THE AIR TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY AND ALLOW CARRIERS TO MARKET AND SELL TICKETS AND/OR CARGO SERVICE ON EACH OTHER S FLIGHTS. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY LIMITED TO CODESHARING ON CERTAIN ROUTES. ALL OF DELTA S CODESHARE RELATIONSHIPS WITH FOREIGN CARRIERS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMPLY WITH U.S. LAW. DELTA HAS CODESHARE AGREEMENTS FOR EXAMPLE WITH AEROMEXICO KOREAN AIR AND VIRGIN BLUE AIRLINES. DELTA DOES NOT HAVE ANY CODESHARE AGREEMENTS WITH ANY CARRIERS BASED IN CUBA IRAN SUDAN OR SYRIA. DELTA DOES NOT CODESHARE ON ANY ROUTES TO OR FROM CUBA OPERATED BY A CODESHARE PARTNER. DELTA DOES HAVE A PASSENGER CODESHARE AGREEMENT WITH KLM FOR THE CITY PAIR AMSTERDAM TO KHARTOUM (SUDAN). INTERLINE AGREEMENTS ARE ALSO COMMON IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY. THESE AGREEMENTS ALLOW PARTICIPATING CARRIERS TO SELL A SINGLE TICKET FOR TRAVEL ON MULTIPLE CARRIERS ALLOWING THE PASSENGER S BAGGAGE TO BE TRANSFERRED SEAMLESSLY BETWEEN CONNECTING FLIGHTS OF EACH AIRLINE. INTERLINE AGREEMENTS MAY ALSO PROVIDE FOR CARGO SHIPMENTS BETWEEN CONNECTING FLIGHTS OF EACH AIRLINE. DELTA HAS ENTERED INTO INTERLINE AGREEMENTS WITH MORE THAN 200 U.S. AND FOREIGN AIR CARRIERS BUT HAS NO INTERLINE AGREEMENT WITH ANY CARRIER BASED IN CUBA SYRIA OR SUDAN. UNTIL RECENTLY DELTA HAD AN INTERLINE AGREEMENT WITH IRAN AIR BUT THIS AGREEMENT WAS TERMINATED WHEN OFAC ADDED IRAN AIR TO THE SDN LIST. ADDITIONALLY NORTHWEST AIRLINES INC. ( NORTHWEST ) WHICH WAS ACQUIRED BY DELTA ON OCTOBER 29 2008 AND MERGED INTO DELTA ON DECEMBER 31 2009 (THE MERGER DATE ) HAD TWO INTERLINE AGREEMENTS WITH IRAN AIR. ONE OF THESE INTERLINE AGREEMENTS WAS TERMINATED ON THE MERGER DATE THE OTHER WAS TERMINATED AS A RESULT OF THE ADDITION OF IRAN AIR TO THE SDN LIST. __________________________________________________________________ PAGE 6 U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOVEMBER 4 2011 PURSUANT TO CODESHARE AND INTERLINE AGREEMENTS DELTA EMPLOYEES OR ANY OF THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF INDEPENDENT TRAVEL AGENTS AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE TICKETS MAY SELL INTERLINE TICKETS ISSUED UNDER DELTA S CARRIER CODE (006) (FORMERLY REFERRED TO AS SALES ON DELTA TICKET STOCK WHEN TICKETS WERE ISSUED IN PAPER FORM) FOR TRAVEL THAT INCLUDES FLIGHT SEGMENTS OPERATED BY OTHER CARRIERS TO OR FROM IRAN (ON CARRIERS OTHER THAN IRAN AIR) SUDAN OR SYRIA (ON CARRIERS OTHER THAN SYRIAN ARAB AIRLINES). WHEN THESE TICKET SALES UNDER DELTA S CARRIER CODE OCCUR DELTA RECEIVES A SMALL COMMISSION (KNOWN AS AN INTERLINE SALES COMMISSION OR ISC ). AS A RESULT DELTA HAS LAWFULLY RECEIVED A DE MINIMIS AMOUNT OF REVENUE FROM FLIGHTS TO CERTAIN OF THE FOUR COUNTRIES AS REPORTED IN RESPONSE TO COMMENT NO. 2 BELOW. DELTA S COMPLIANCE POLICY EXPLICITLY PROHIBITS EMPLOYEES OR INDEPENDENT TRAVEL AGENTS AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE TICKETS UNDER DELTA S OR NORTHWEST S CARRIER CODE (WHICH WAS AVAILABLE THROUGH EARLY 2010) FROM SELLING ANY TICKETS ON FLIGHTS TO OR FROM CUBA. NOTWITHSTANDING DELTA S POLICY AND COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES INDEPENDENT AGENTS OCCASIONALLY EXCEEDED THEIR AUTHORITY AND ISSUED INTERLINE TICKETS UNDER DELTA S OR NORTHWEST S CARRIER CODES FOR TRAVEL TO OR FROM CUBA. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE TICKETS WERE ISSUED BY FOREIGN INDEPENDENT TRAVEL AGENTS BOOKING TICKETS THROUGH A GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ( GDS ) NOT THROUGH DELTA S RESERVATION SYSTEM. THESE FOREIGN INDEPENDENT AGENTS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO DELTA SUPERVISION OR CONTROL. AS A RESULT OF THESE VIOLATIONS OF DELTA POLICY DELTA RECEIVED A DE MINIMUS AMOUNT OF REVENUE (IN THE FORM OF COMMISSIONS) FROM TICKETS SOLD USING THE DELTA CODE FOR FLIGHTS OPERATED BY NON-U.S. CARRIERS BETWEEN THIRD COUNTRIES AND CUBA: 513 1 936 543 AND 0 IN 2008 2009 2010 AND THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2011 RESPECTIVELY.

DELTA DOES NOT OPERATE PASSENGER OR CARGO SERVICE TO ANY OF THE FOUR COUNTRIES AND FLIGHTS TO OR FROM CUBA ARE NOT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE JOINT VENTURE. KLM CURRENTLY OPERATES FLIGHTS TO AND FROM IRAN AND SUDAN WHILE AIR FRANCE AND ALITALIA CURRENTLY OPERATE FLIGHTS TO AND FROM SYRIA. THOSE FLIGHTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE SCOPE OF THE JOINT VENTURE THEREFORE DELTA SHARES IN THE REVENUES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FLIGHT OPERATIONS PURSUANT TO A FORMULA SET FORTH IN THE JV AGREEMENT. DELTA S SHARE OF REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE JV AGREEMENT NET OF EXPENSES FOR EACH OF THE FOUR COUNTRIES IS SET FORTH BELOW IN THE RESPONSE TO COMMENT NO. 2. OTHER INFORMATION DELTA S WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES INCLUDING COMAIR INC. NEITHER OPERATE IN NOR HAVE OFFICES FACILITIES EQUIPMENT GROUND SERVICES SALES AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES IN ANY OF THE FOUR COUNTRIES. DELTA ALSO HAS CONTRACT CARRIER AGREEMENTS WITH EIGHT UNAFFILIATED REGIONAL CARRIERS BUT NONE OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS INVOLVES OPERATIONS IN OR FLIGHTS TO AND FROM ANY OF THE FOUR COUNTRIES.

AS A RESULT DELTA CANNOT RESPOND TO THE STAFF S INQUIRIES ON BEHALF OF OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY OTHER CARRIER. DELTA DOES NOT PROVIDE LOANS OR SIMILAR FINANCING TO ANY GOVERNMENT OF ANY OF THE FOUR COUNTRIES OR ENTITIES CONTROLLED BY THEM. WITH RESPECT TO PAYMENTS FOR SERVICES RENDERED DELTA HAS RECEIVED A SEPARATE SPECIFIC LICENSE FROM OFAC[5]5 AUTHORIZING PAYMENTS TO CUBA FOR OVERFLIGHT SERVICES PROVIDED TO DELTA AIRCRAFT THAT ENTER AIRSPACE CONTROLLED BY CUBA EN ROUTE TO DESTINATIONS OTHER THAN CUBA. DELTA PERIODICALLY MAKES SUCH PAYMENTS TO THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT AND PROVIDES OFAC WITH AN ANNUAL DETAILED ACCOUNTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF ITS LICENSE. IN ADDITION DELTA MAKES AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN OF THE FOUR COUNTRIES FOR OVERFLIGHT AND RELATED SERVICES. THE AMOUNTS PAID FOR OVERFLIGHT AND RELATED SERVICES ARE SET FORTH IN THE RESPONSE TO COMMENT NO. 2. _____ 5 THIS LICENSE IS SEPARATE FROM THE CSP LICENSE DISCUSSED ABOVE. __________________________________________________________________ PAGE 8 U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOVEMBER 4 2011 2. PLEASE DISCUSS THE MATERIALITY OF YOUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN AND OTHER CONTACTS WITH CUBA IRAN SUDAN AND/OR SYRIA DESCRIBED IN RESPONSE TO THE FOREGOING COMMENT AND WHETHER THEY CONSTITUTE A MATERIAL INVESTMENT RISK FOR YOUR SECURITY HOLDERS. YOU SHOULD ADDRESS MATERIALITY IN QUANTITATIVE TERMS INCLUDING THE APPROXIMATE DOLLAR AMOUNTS OF ANY REVENUES ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THE REFERENCED COUNTRIES FOR THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS AND THE SUBSEQUENT INTERIM PERIOD. YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD INCLUDE ANY DOLLAR AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID THE GOVERNMENTS OF CUBA IRAN SUDAN AND/OR SYRIA FOR OVERFLIGHT SERVICES PROVIDED TO DELTA AIRCRAFT THAT ENTERED THE COMMERCIAL AIRSPACE OF THOSE COUNTRIES EN ROUTE TO OTHER DESTINATIONS AND ANY DOLLAR AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID RELATED TO INTERLINE FLIGHTS TO AIRLINE CARRIERS LOCATED IN ANY OF THE REFERENCED COUNTRIES FOR FLIGHT SEGMENTS OPERATED BY THOSE AIRLINE CARRIERS. ALSO ADDRESS MATERIALITY IN TERMS OF QUALITATIVE FACTORS THAT A REASONABLE INVESTOR WOULD DEEM IMPORTANT IN MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF CORPORATE ACTIVITIES UPON A COMPANY S REPUTATION AND SHARE VALUE. AS YOU KNOW VARIOUS STATE AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS UNIVERSITIES AND OTHER INVESTORS HAVE PROPOSED OR ADOPTED DIVESTMENT OR SIMILAR INITIATIVES REGARDING INVESTMENT IN COMPANIES THAT DO BUSINESS WITH U.S.-DESIGNATED STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM. YOUR MATERIALITY ANALYSIS SHOULD ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE INVESTOR SENTIMENT EVIDENCED BY SUCH ACTIONS DIRECTED TOWARD COMPANIES THAT HAVE BUSINESS WITH CUBA IRAN SUDAN OR SYRIA. DELTA HAS A CORPORATE POLICY TO COMPLY WITH U.S. ECONOMIC SANCTIONS LAWS. DELTA S TOTAL REVENUES FOR 2008 2009 2010 AND THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2011 WERE 22.7 BILLION 28.0 BILLION 31.8 BILLION AND 16.9 BILLION RESPECTIVELY. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE DELTA DOES NOT OPERATE PASSENGER OR CARGO SERVICE TO OR FROM SYRIA SUDAN OR IRAN AND ONLY IN LATE 2011 COMMENCED PASSENGER CHARTER SERVICE TO CUBA IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN OFAC LICENSED CARRIER SERVICE PROVIDER. THE REVENUE RECEIVED BY DELTA FOR FLIGHTS OPERATED TO OR FROM THE FOUR COUNTRIES AS DESCRIBED BELOW IS DE MINIMUS AND IMMATERIAL TO INVESTORS IN LIGHT OF DELTA S TOTAL REVENUES. LIKEWISE THE AMOUNTS PAID BY DELTA TO IRAN AIR THE ONLY CARRIER BASED IN THE FOUR COUNTRIES WITH WHICH DELTA HAD AT ONE TIME (BUT NOT NOW) A CODE SHARE OR INTERLINE AGREEMENT WERE DE MINIMUS AND IMMATERIAL. ADDITIONALLY DELTA EXPECTS THE REVENUES FROM ITS CUBA PASSENGER CHARTER OPERATIONS TO BE DE MINIMUS AND IMMATERIAL. __________________________________________________________________ PAGE 9 U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOVEMBER 4 2011 TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF DELTA S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER GENERAL COUNSEL CORPORATE SECRETARY AND DIRECTOR OF INVESTOR RELATIONS DELTA HAS NOT RECEIVED ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM INVESTORS OR SECURITIES ANALYSTS REGARDING DELTA S VERY MINIMAL CONTACTS WITH ANY OF THE FOUR COUNTRIES. LIKEWISE DELTA DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS CONTACTS WITH THE FOUR COUNTRIES WILL CAUSE IT TO BE A TARGET OF GROUPS WITH DIVESTMENT OR SIMILAR INITIATIVES. AS A RESULT DELTA BELIEVES ITS LIMITED CONTACTS IN THE FOUR COUNTRIES DO NOT CONSTITUTE A FACTOR A REASONABLE INVESTOR WOULD DEEM IMPORTANT IN MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION.
