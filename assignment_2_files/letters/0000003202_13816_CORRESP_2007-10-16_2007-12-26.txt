FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2006 FILED MARCH 5 2007 FILE NO. 0-19978 DEAR MR. FOTI: ALASKA AIR GROUP INC. AND ALASKA AIRLINES INC. (THE COMPANY ) RECEIVED YOUR LETTER DATED SEPTEMBER 18 2007 (THE LETTER ) SETTING FORTH THE COMMENTS OF THE STAFF (THE STAFF ) OF THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ON OUR ABOVE-REFERENCED REPORTS FILED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. OUR RESPONSES TO THE SPECIFIC COMMENTS ARE SET FORTH BELOW. FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE STAFF EACH COMMENT FROM THE LETTER IS RESTATED IN BOLD PRIOR TO OUR RESPONSE TO SUCH COMMENT. ALASKA AIR GROUP INC. FORM 10-K (FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2006) SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA PAGE 27 1. REFER TO YOUR NON-GAAP DISCLOSURES SHOWN IN NOTE A BEGINNING ON PAGE 30. AS DISCUSSED BELOW UNDER OUR COMMENTS FOR MD A THESE NON-GAAP DISCLOSURES DO NOT APPEAR TO COMPLY WITH THE GUIDANCE IN ITEM 10(E)(1)(II) OF REGULATION S-K AND THE QUESTION AND ANSWER NO. 8 OF THE STAFF S FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS REGARDING THE USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ISSUED JUNE 13 2003. PLEASE REVISE YOUR PRESENTATION TO EXCLUDE PROVIDING TOTALS THAT ADJUST THE GAAP STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AMOUNTS. FOR EXAMPLE WE NOTE YOU PROVIDE OPERATING EXPENSES PER ______________________________________________________________________ ASM THEN FURTHER ADJUST THIS ITEM TO EXCLUDE AIRCRAFT FUEL FLEET TRANSITION COSTS RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND ADJUSTMENTS AND NAVIGATION FUEL REFUND TO ARRIVE AT OPERATING EXPENSES PER ASM EXCLUDING... THESE RELATED EXPENSES WHICH IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE. INSTEAD YOU SHOULD CONTINUE PRESENTING GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES PER ASM AS WELL AS SOLELY THE SEPARATE IMPACT OF THE EXCLUDED ITEMS (I.E. AIRCRAFT FUEL FLEET TRANSITION COSTS RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND ADJUSTMENTS AND NAVIGATION FUEL REFUND ETC.) PER ASM WITH DISCLOSURE ON WHY PRESENTING THIS INFORMATION IS MEANINGFUL AND RELEVANT AS THESE EXPENSES AND COSTS MAY BE CONSIDERED UNUSUAL NON-RECURRING OR BEYOND THE COMPANY S CONTROL. SIMILAR RECONCILIATIONS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FOR INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE TAXES AND ACCOUNTING CHANGE AND AIRCRAFT FUEL. BEGINNING WITH YOUR SEPTEMBER 30 2007 QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q PLEASE DELETE THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES AS AN INVESTOR IS ABLE TO INDIVIDUALLY CALCULATE SUCH MEASURES WITH THE SUGGESTED DISCLOSURES AS CITED ABOVE. WE NOTE THE STAFF S COMMENT AND WILL REVISE FUTURE FILINGS TO ELIMINATE NON-GAAP MEASURES RELATED TO SUBTOTALS OR TOTALS ON OUR STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE WE WILL ELIMINATE THE SENTENCES LISTED BELOW AND OTHER SUCH DISCLOSURES. INSTEAD AND AS SUGGESTED BY THE STAFF WE WILL PRESENT SEPARATELY THOSE INDIVIDUAL ITEMS (SUCH AS THE ITEMS REFERRED TO ABOVE) THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE IMPORTANT FOR A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR RESULTS AND WILL ENHANCE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHY THAT INFORMATION IS MEANINGFUL TO OUR INVESTORS. O THE SENTENCE THAT BEGINS EXCLUDING FUEL THE FLEET TRANSITION COSTS THE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND A 2005 NAVIGATION FEE REFUND OUR OPERATING COSTS WERE... FOUND ON PAGE 34 OF OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2006. O THE SENTENCE THAT BEGINS EXCLUDING FUEL THE FLEET TRANSITION COSTS THE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND A 2005 NAVIGATION FEE REFUND AND STATING FUEL ON AN ECONOMIC BASIS AS DESCRIBED BELOW ALASKA AND HORIZON REPORTED INCOME BEFORE TAXES OF.... ALSO ON PAGE 34 OF THE FORM 10-K. O THE SENTENCE THAT BEGINS EXCLUDING THESE ITEMS AND WITH FUEL STATED ON AN ECONOMIC BASIS AS EXPLAINED ABOVE OUR CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME WOULD HAVE BEEN... FOUND ON PAGE 38 OF THE FORM 10-K. ______________________________________________________________________ SIMILARLY WE WILL REVISE FUTURE FILINGS TO ELIMINATE THE PRESENTATION OF GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES PER AVAILABLE SEAT MILE (ASM) EXCLUDING ITEMS SUCH AS AIRCRAFT IMPAIRMENT OR FLEET TRANSITION CHARGES RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OR ADJUSTMENTS OR FLEET TRANSITION COSTS (THE SPECIAL OR NON-RECURRING ITEMS). ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT OUR INVESTORS UNDERSTANDING OF OUR UNIT COST (COST PER ASM) PERFORMANCE IS ENHANCED BY SUCH PRESENTATION AND THAT OTHER INTERESTED READERS SEEK THAT INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AGREES THAT AN INVESTOR CAN CALCULATE THE DESIRED COST METRIC WITH THE INFORMATION IF IT IS PRESENTED SEPARATELY. AS WITH THE IMPACT ON EARNINGS WE WILL ENHANCE OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT WHY THIS INFORMATION IS MEANINGFUL TO INVESTORS. HOWEVER UNLIKE THE METRICS DISCUSSED IMMEDIATELY ABOVE WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO PRESENT UNIT COST PERFORMANCE EXCLUDING FUEL AND BEGINNING IN 2007 COSTS INCURRED BY ALASKA AIRLINES ASSOCIATED WITH REGIONAL FLYING. WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH PRESENTATION IS CONSISTENT IN ALL RESPECTS WITH ITEM 10 OF REGULATION S-K AND QUESTION AND ANSWER NO. 8 OF THE STAFF S FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS REGARDING THE USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ISSUED JUNE 13 2003 (THE FAQ ). WHILE WE CONCEDE THESE METRICS ELIMINATE RECURRING COSTS WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE STAFF HAS STATED THAT THERE IS NO PER SE PROHIBITION AGAINST REMOVING A RECURRING ITEM SO LONG AS THE COMPANY MEETS THE BURDEN OF DEMONSTRATING THE USEFULNESS OF ANY MEASURE THAT EXCLUDES RECURRING ITEMS ESPECIALLY IF THE NON-GAAP MEASURE IS USED TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE. WE BELIEVE IT IS VITAL FOR INVESTORS TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION TO BETTER UNDERSTAND CHANGES IN OUR UNIT OPERATING COSTS. THE FAQ THEN SUGGESTS DISCLOSURES THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT ANY NON-GAAP DISCLOSURES ARE NOT MISLEADING. IN RESPONSE TO THE STAFF S COMMENT WE WILL ENHANCE OUR DISCLOSURE (INCLUDING NOTE A ON PAGE 30) TO CLARIFY HOW THE NON-GAAP MEASURE IS USED THE REASONS WHY WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL AND ITS LIMITATIONS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR DISCLOSURE WILL BE SIMILAR TO THE FOLLOWING: REASONS FOR EXCLUDING THE UNIT COST IMPACT OF BOTH FUEL AND REGIONAL FLYING COSTS: O OUR COST PER ASM EXCLUDING FUEL AND REGIONAL FLYING COSTS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MEASURES USED BY MANAGEMENT OUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER AND THE BOARD IN ASSESSING THE RESULTS OF OUR COST REDUCTION EFFORTS AND THE OPERATING RESULTS OF ALASKA S MAINLINE OPERATION WHICH INCLUDES THE B737 AND MD80 AIRCRAFT BRANDED IN ALASKA AIRLINES LIVERY. OUR INTENT IS TO GIVE OUR INVESTORS A WINDOW INTO THE EXECUTIVE SUITE SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT METRICS ARE IMPORTANT TO US. REGIONAL FLYING COSTS ARE APPLICABLE TO THE ALASKA AIRLINES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ONLY. O COST PER ASM EXCLUDING FUEL AND REGIONAL FLYING COSTS (AND OTHER ITEMS AS SPECIFIED IN OUR GOVERNING DOCUMENTS) IS AN IMPORTANT METRIC IN THE EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLAN THAT COVERS COMPANY MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTIVES. ______________________________________________________________________ O COST PER ASM IS A METRIC COMMONLY USED BY INDUSTRY ANALYSTS AND WE BELIEVE IT IS THE BASIS BY WHICH THEY COMPARE OUR AIRLINES TO OTHERS IN THE INDUSTRY. IT IS ALSO A MEASURE USED BY SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS. WE CAN PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL EVIDENCE TO THE STAFF TO SUPPORT THIS ASSERTION. O IT IS THE SUBJECT OF FREQUENT QUESTIONS FROM HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK. REASONS FOR EXCLUDING THE UNIT COST IMPACT OF FUEL: O BY ELIMINATING FUEL EXPENSE WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE BETTER VISIBILITY INTO THE RESULTS OF OUR NON-FUEL COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES. OUR INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH FIXED COSTS SO EVEN A SMALL REDUCTION IN NON-FUEL OPERATING COSTS CAN RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN OPERATING RESULTS. WE BELIEVE THAT ALL DOMESTIC CARRIERS ARE SIMILARLY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN JET FUEL COSTS OVER THE LONG RUN SO IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US (AND THUS INVESTORS) TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF (AND TRENDS IN) COMPANY-SPECIFIC COST DRIVERS SUCH AS LABOR RATES AND PRODUCTIVITY AIRPORT COSTS MAINTENANCE COSTS ETC. WHICH ARE MORE CONTROLLABLE BY MANAGEMENT. O ALTHOUGH WE DISCLOSE OUR MAINLINE UNIT REVENUES TO ELIMINATE THOSE REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH REGIONAL FLYING PERFORMED BY OTHERS ON OUR BEHALF WE DO NOT (NOR ARE WE ABLE TO) PRESENT UNIT REVENUES EXCLUDING THE IMPACT THAT RISING FUEL COSTS HAVE HAD ON TICKET PRICES. THIS IS A LIMITATION OF A NON-GAAP MEASURE THAT EXCLUDES FUEL AS FUEL REPRESENTS NEARLY 30 OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES AND FLUCTUATIONS IN FUEL PRICES ARE OFTEN THE DRIVER OF CHANGES IN UNIT REVENUES AT LEAST IN THE MID-TO-LONG TERM. RECOGNIZING THIS WE INTEND TO CAUTION INVESTORS AND OTHERS NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON UNIT COST EXCLUDING FUEL AS A MEASURE OR PREDICTOR OF FUTURE PROFITABILITY. REASONS FOR EXCLUDING THE UNIT COST IMPACT OF REGIONAL FLYING COSTS: O ELIMINATING REGIONAL FLYING COSTS OR PURCHASED CAPACITY ALLOWS OUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER TO MEASURE THE OPERATIONAL COSTS OF ALASKA AIRLINES MAINLINE BUSINESS EXCLUDING THE PAYMENTS WE MAKE TO OTHER OPERATING CARRIERS THAT FLY CERTAIN REGIONAL MARKETS FOR ALASKA AIRLINES. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS YEAR IN REVIEW PAGE 33 2. REFERENCE IS MADE TO YOUR VARIOUS DISCLOSURES REGARDING EXCLUDING FUEL TRANSITION COSTS RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND THE NAVIGATION FEE REFUND IN DISCUSSION OF THE CHANGES IN OPERATING RESULTS. THESE DISCLOSURES REPRESENT NON-GAAP MEASURES AND DO NOT COMPLY WITH THE GUIDANCE IN ITEM 10(E)(1)(II) OF REGULATION S-K. WE SUGGEST YOU REVISE YOUR NARRATIVE TO DISCUSS THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT (I.E. AMOUNT OR PERCENTAGE) OF EACH OF THESE EXCLUDED ITEMS TO THE RELATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS LINE ITEM RATHER THAN PROVIDING THE NONCONFORMING NON-GAAP MEASURE. YOU MAY CHOOSE TO PROVIDE A TABULAR PRESENTATION THAT INCLUDES EACH OF THE SIGNIFICANT ______________________________________________________________________ INDIVIDUAL ITEMS BY FISCAL YEAR TO ENHANCE THE NARRATIVE DISCUSSION WITHOUT PROVIDING A SUB-TOTAL THAT EQUATES TO A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE. IN THIS REGARD ALL REFERENCES TO FOR EXAMPLE EXCLUDING FUEL THE FLEET TRANSITION COSTS THE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES... WOULD BE DELETED AND REPLACED WITH A DISCUSSION AS TO THE IMPACT OF THAT ITEM TO YOUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE REFER YOU TO QUESTION NO. 8 OF THE STAFF S FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS REGARDING THE USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ISSUED JUNE 13 2003. WE REFER THE STAFF TO OUR RESPONSE TO COMMENT 1 ABOVE. WE INTEND TO REVISE OUR FUTURE FILINGS IN A MANNER THAT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT IS OUTLINED ABOVE. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005 PAGE 37 3. FURTHER YOUR DISCUSSION UNDER THIS SECTION SHOULD BE SIMILARLY REVISED TO DELETE THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES AND INSTEAD TO DISCUSS THE IMPACT THE ITEM HAD ON THE PARTICULAR STATEMENT OF OPERATION LINE ITEM. FOR EXAMPLE ON PAGE 38 WE ALSO NOTE YOU PROVIDE A NON-GAAP MEASURE OF CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME EXCLUDING CERTAIN ITEMS. PLEASE REVISE. AS REQUESTED BY THE STAFF WE WILL DELETE THE NON-GAAP CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME OR LOSS MEASURE AND WILL REVISE DISCLOSURES ACCORDINGLY IN FUTURE FILINGS. 4. EXPAND THE DISCUSSION OF AIRCRAFT FUEL FOR BOTH ALASKA AIRLINES EXPENSES AND HORIZON AIR EXPENSES TO DISCUSS THE AMOUNT OF GAAP FUEL EXPENSE AS REFLECTED IN YOUR STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. IN RESPONSE TO THE STAFF S COMMENT WE WILL EXPAND THE AIRCRAFT FUEL DISCUSSION TO INCLUDE MORE EXPLANATION OF THE CHANGES IN GAAP FUEL EXPENSE IN FUTURE FILINGS. WE EXPECT THAT THE REVISED DISCLOSURE WILL FOCUS ON THREE UNIQUE DRIVERS OF FUEL EXPENSE AS MEASURED ON A GAAP BASIS AS FOLLOWS: O FUEL GALLONS CONSUMED O THE PRICE THAT WE PAY OUR SUPPLIERS FOR FUEL DELIVERED TO OUR AIRCRAFT AND O THE IMPACT OF CHANGES TO THE VALUE OF OUR HEDGE PORTFOLIO DUE TO CHANGES IN OIL PRICES. WE PLAN TO ALSO RETAIN THE DISCUSSION REGARDING GAINS FROM OUR HEDGING PROGRAM AS WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR READERS OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT- PERIOD CASH FLOWS OF OUR HEDGING PROGRAM. 5. PLEASE EXPAND YOUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR EACH OF ALASKA AND HORIZON TO DISCUSS THE PRIMARY PROFITABILITY MEASURE USED BY YOUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER. TO THE EXTENT THIS MEASURE IS INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE INCOME TAX AND ACCOUNTING CHANGE AS SHOWN IN NOTE 14 TO YOUR AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PLEASE DISCLOSE. ALSO PROVIDE A DISCUSSION OF YOUR CONSOLIDATED NET (LOSS)/INCOME. ______________________________________________________________________ IN RESPONSE TO THE STAFF S COMMENT WE WILL REVISE OUR FUTURE FILINGS TO DISCUSS INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE INCOME TAXES FOR EACH OF THE OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION OF THE PERIODIC REPORTS SO THAT A READER CAN QUICKLY KNOW THE RESULT OF EACH OPERATING COMPANY AND MAKE A MORE CLEAR LINKAGE TO THE SEGMENT INFORMATION IN THE FOOTNOTES. WE WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE STAFF CORRECTLY ASSUMES THAT INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE INCOME TAXES FOR EACH OPERATING SUBSIDIARY IS THE PRIMARY PROFITABILITY MEASURE USED BY THE CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER (AND THE BOARD AS WELL). HOWEVER THE CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER AND THE BOARD ALSO CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF ITEMS SUCH AS FLEET TRANSITION COSTS AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES IN THEIR EVALUATIONS OF SEGMENT PERFORMANCE. WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO KNOW THIS AND WILL SO STATE. ADDITIONALLY WE WILL EXPAND OUR DISCUSSION OF CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (LOSS) IN FUTURE FILINGS BY POINTING OUT THAT THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE RESULTS OF THE OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES AND REFER THE READER TO THE APPROPRIATE DISCUSSIONS FOR ALASKA AND HORIZON. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 - LEASED AIRCRAFT RETURN COSTS PAGE 66 6. WE NOTE THAT YOU ACCRUE CASH PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH RETURNING LEASED AIRCRAFT PRIOR TO THE SCHEDULED AIRCRAFT RETURN DATE AND THESE RETURN COSTS INCLUDE A NUMBER OF FACTORS WHERE THE ACTUAL AMOUNT IS NOT KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY UNTIL LEASE TERMINATION. IF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT PERIODS INCLUDE ANY FAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES OF THE ACCRUALS IN ANY SUBSEQUENT ACCOUNTING PERIOD UPON LEASE TERMINATION THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED OPERATING RESULTS PLEASE EXPAND THE NOTE TO PROVIDE THE DISCLOSURE INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE AS PRESCRIBED BY PARAGRAPH 22 OF SFAS 154. PLEASE ADVISE AND REVISE ACCORDINGLY. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES OF ANY OF THE ACCRUALS FOR LEASE TERMINATION COSTS DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. WE PLAN TO REVISE OUR DISCLOSURE IN FUTURE FILINGS TO SPECIFICALLY STATE THIS FACT. IF THESE CHANGES ARE MATERIAL IN THE FUTURE WE WILL EXPAND OUR DISCLOSURE TO INCLUDE THE EFFECT OF SUCH CHANGES. NOTE 2. FLEET TRANSITION AND IMPAIRMENT PAGE 70 7. IF YOU ELECT TO MAKE REFERENCE TO AN INDEPENDENT OR THIRD-PARTY APPRAISAL OR VALUATION YOU MUST SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY THE APPRAISER IN YOUR REPORT. PLEASE REVISE ACCORDINGLY OR DELETE ANY SUCH REFERENCE FROM YOUR FILINGS. IN ADDITION IF YOU INCORPORATE A REPORT WITH SUCH A REFERENCE INTO ANY REGISTRATION STATEMENT THE APPRAISER MUST BE IDENTIFIED AS AN EXPERT IN THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND HIS CONSENT MUST BE FILED AS AN EXHIBIT. PLEASE REVISE OR ADVISE AS APPROPRIATE. AS REQUESTED BY THE STAFF WE WILL ELIMINATE REFERENCE TO AN INDEPENDENT OR THIRD-PARTY APPRAISAL OR VALUATION IN FUTURE FILINGS. ______________________________________________________________________ NOTE 6 - OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES (CURRENT) PAGE 76 8. WE NOTE IN THE LAST TWO FISCAL YEARS THAT 246 MILLION AND 217 MILLION OF THE OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITY BALANCE ARE AGGREGATED INTO AN OTHER CATEGORY. AS THE OTHER CATEGORY REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIVE AMOUNT OF THIS BALANCE SHEET CAPTION IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER ANY SEPARATE ITEM REPRESENTS IN EXCESS OF 5 PERCENT OF TOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES IN ANY OF THE PERIODS. IF SO PLEASE EXPAND THE TABLE TO SEPARATELY DISCLOSE EACH ITEM THAT EXCEEDS THIS QUANTIFIABLE THRESHOLD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE IN RULE 5-02(20) OF REGULATION S-X. WE WISH TO ADVISE THE STAFF THAT THERE WERE NO SEPARATE ITEMS IN OTHER THAT REPRESENTED MORE THAN 5 OF TOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31 2006 AND 2005.
