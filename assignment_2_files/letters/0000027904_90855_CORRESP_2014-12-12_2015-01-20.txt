DELTA S OFAC SECURITY LICENSE EXPIRED IN OCTOBER 2014 AND DELTA IS IN THE PROCESS OF RENEWING THE LICENSE. IN MID-2011 DELTA ENTERED INTO A CHARTER AGREEMENT WITH MARAZUL. THE DETAILS OF THAT AGREEMENT WERE DESCRIBED IN THE NOVEMBER 4 2011 LETTER. DELTA CEASED OPERATING SCHEDULED CHARTER SERVICE WITH MARAZUL IN DECEMBER 2012 YET REMAINS AVAILABLE TO OPERATE AD HOC CHARTERS ON BEHALF OF MARAZUL ON AN AS-NEEDED BASIS.

DELTA DOES NOT HAVE ANY CODESHARE AGREEMENTS WITH ANY CARRIERS BASED IN ANY OF THE THREE COUNTRIES. DELTA DOES NOT CODESHARE ON ANY ROUTES TO OR FROM CUBA OR SYRIA OPERATED BY A CODESHARE PARTNER. DELTA HAD A PASSENGER CODESHARE AGREEMENT WITH KLM FOR THE CITY PAIR AMSTERDAM TO KHARTOUM (SUDAN) UNTIL KLM DISCONTINUED THAT SERVICE IN MARCH 2013. ____________ ^1 A SUMMARY OF APPLICABLE LAWS IS INCLUDED IN THE NOVEMBER 4 2011 LETTER. PAGE 3 U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION DECEMBER 12 2014 INTERLINE AGREEMENTS ARE ALSO COMMON IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY. THESE AGREEMENTS ALLOW PARTICIPATING CARRIERS TO SELL A SINGLE TICKET FOR TRAVEL ON MULTIPLE CARRIERS ALLOWING THE PASSENGER S BAGGAGE TO BE TRANSFERRED SEAMLESSLY BETWEEN CONNECTING FLIGHTS OF EACH AIRLINE. INTERLINE AGREEMENTS MAY ALSO PROVIDE FOR CARGO SHIPMENTS BETWEEN CONNECTING FLIGHTS OF EACH AIRLINE. DELTA HAS ENTERED INTO INTERLINE AGREEMENTS WITH MORE THAN 155 U.S. AND FOREIGN AIR CARRIERS BUT HAS NO INTERLINE AGREEMENT WITH ANY CARRIER BASED IN CUBA SYRIA OR SUDAN.
