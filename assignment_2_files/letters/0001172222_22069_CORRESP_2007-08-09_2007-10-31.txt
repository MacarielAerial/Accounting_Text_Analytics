DEBT AND COMMON STOCK WARRANT PAGE 76 8. WE NOTE YOUR DISCLOSURE THAT IN CONNECTION WITH THE AMENDMENT OF TERM B CREDIT FACILITY YOU ISSUED WARRANTS TO THE TERM B CREDIT FACILITY LENDERS AND ANOTHER PARTY TO ACQUIRE 4 050 000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. PLEASE TELL US AND DISCLOSE IN FUTURE FILINGS THE INITIAL TERMS OF THE WARRANTS AND HOW YOU ACCOUNTED FOR THE ISSUANCE OF THESE WARRANTS. ALSO IN FUTURE FILINGS PLEASE INCLUDE A TABLE SHOWING THE ACTIVITY OF THE OUTSTANDING WARRANTS DURING EACH PERIOD FOR WHICH A BALANCE SHEET IS PRESENTED. SEE RULE 4-08(I) OF REGULATION SX. IN CONNECTION WITH THE AMENDMENT OF THE TERM B FACILITY IN MARCH 2006 THE COMPANY ISSUED WARRANTS TO THE TERM B CREDIT FACILITY LENDERS AND ANOTHER PARTY TO ACQUIRE 4 050 000 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK (TERM B WARRANTS). AS DISCUSSED IN OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES EMBEDDED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2006 WE ACCOUNTED FOR THE ISSUANCE OF THE TERM B WARRANTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 14 ACCOUNTING FOR CONVERTIBLE DEBT AND DEBT ISSUED WITH STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS (APB 14) WHERE THE PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS ALLOCABLE TO THE WARRANTS IS TREATED AS ADDITIONAL PAID-IN-CAPITAL AND RECORDED IN EQUITY. THE ALLOCATION BETWEEN THE DEBT AND THE WARRANTS WERE BASED ON THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUES OF THE TWO SECURITIES AT TIME OF ISSUANCE. THE RESULTING DEBT DISCOUNT IS AMORTIZED USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE TERM B CREDIT FACILITY. AS MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 6 ON JULY 11 2006 AND IN CONNECTION WITH HAWAIIAN S 10 MILLION PREPAYMENT OF THE TERM B CREDIT FACILITY TERM B WARRANTS TO ACQUIRE 500 000 SHARES OF THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK EXPIRED PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS. THE REMAINING TERM B WARRANTS TO ACQUIRE APPROXIMATELY 3.55 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK ARE EXERCISABLE FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE HAVE AN EXERCISE PRICE OF 5.00 PER SHARE AND CONTAIN A FEATURE WHEREBY THE COMPANY CAN FORCE THE EXERCISE OF THE TERM B WARRANTS AT ANYTIME AFTER THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK IS AT OR ABOVE 9.00 PER SHARE FOR 30 CONSECUTIVE CALENDAR DAYS. AS WARRANT EXERCISE PRICES ARE GREATER THAN THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMMON SHARES THERE HAS BEEN NO WARRANT ACTIVITY SINCE THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006. HOWEVER SHOULD THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY INCREASE IN ADDITION TO THE DISCLOSURES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (DEFICIENCY) THE COMPANY WILL INCLUDE A TABLE OF WARRANT ACTIVITY IN FUTURE FILINGS FOR EACH PERIOD IN WHICH A BALANCE SHEET IS PRESENTED BEGINNING WITH THE FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31 2007. ______________________________________________________________________ 9. WE NOTE THAT YOUR TABLE PRESENTING THE MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS INCLUDES AMOUNTS WHICH TOTAL APPROXIMATELY 189 MILLION. IN FUTURE FILINGS PLEASE REVISE TO ENSURE THAT THE AMOUNTS IN THIS TABLE PRESENT ALL AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT OUTSTANDING AS PRESENTED ON THE FACE OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND IN THE DETAIL TABLE AT THE BEGINNING OF NOTE 6. THE COMPANY HAS DISCLOSED THE MATURITIES OF ITS LONG-TERM DEBT OVER THE FIVE YEARS FOLLOWING THE DATE OF THE BALANCE SHEET IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 47 DISCLOSURE OF LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SUM OF THE MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY 189 MILLION AND THE TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT OUTSTANDING INCLUDED ON THE FACE OF THE BALANCE SHEET IS DUE TO MATURITIES OF THE LONG-TERM DEBT IN YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO 2011. NOTE 7. LEASES PAGE 79 10. WE NOTE YOUR DISCLOSURE THAT LOSSES DUE TO REDEMPTION PREPAYMENT EXTINGUISHING AND MODIFICATION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND LEASE AGREEMENTS INCLUDES A NET EXPENSE OF 2.7 MILLION TO WRITE-OFF LEASE-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND UNFAVORABLE LEASE LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE TERMINATED AND MODIFIED LEASES THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY RECORDED. IT APPEARS THIS 2.7 MILLION PORTION OF THE LOSSES SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) RATHER THAN IN NON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE). PLEASE REVISE FUTURE FILINGS ACCORDINGLY. SEE THE ANALOGOUS GUIDANCE IN NOTE 68 OF SAB 104 (TOPIC 13) AND PARAGRAPH 25 OF SFAS NO. 144. PRIOR TO 2005 HAWAIIAN ENTERED INTO LEASE AGREEMENTS FOR SEVEN NEW BOEING 767-300ER AIRCRAFT AND THREE SPARE ENGINES. THE FIRST THREE AIRCRAFT WERE DELIVERED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001 UNDER 15-YEAR LEASE TERMS AND THE NEXT FOUR AIRCRAFT WERE DELIVERED IN 2002 UNDER 18-YEAR LEASE TERMS. ALL EXECUTED LEASE ARRANGEMENTS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AS OPERATING LEASES UNDER SFAS NO. 13. IN MARCH 2003 HAWAIIAN FILED A VOLUNTARY PETITION FOR REORGANIZATION UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE. IN MAY OF THE SAME YEAR HAWAIIAN REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE LESSOR TO AMEND THE LEASES ON SEVEN AIRCRAFT. THE AMENDED LEASES INCLUDED ESCALATING RENT PAYMENTS AND EARLY LEASE TERMINATION OPTIONS BY THE LESSOR BEGINNING IN MARCH 2007. ON JUNE 2 2005 HAWAIIAN REORGANIZED AND EMERGED FROM CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY. THE TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 141 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. UPON EMERGENCE THE COMPANY RECORDED HAWAIIAN S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THEIR FAIR VALUE AS OF JUNE 2 2005. THE COMPANY COMPLETED A THIRD-PARTY VALUATION OF THE AIRCRAFT AND SPARE ENGINE LEASES AND IT WAS DETERMINED UNDER THE EXISTING TERMS OF THE OPERATING LEASES THAT THE THREE 2001 AIRCRAFT LEASES AND THREE SPARE ENGINES WERE DEEMED FAVORABLE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS. AN INTANGIBLE ASSET WAS RECORDED FOR THE FAVORABLE LEASES WHICH WAS BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE LEASES. ______________________________________________________________________ IN DECEMBER 2006 IN AN EFFORT TO ELIMINATE THE BUSINESS RISK FROM THE ADVERSE AFFECT TO OPERATIONS OF THE POTENTIAL EXERCISE BY THE LESSOR OF ITS EARLY TERMINATION RIGHTS AND THE UNCERTAINTY OVER HAWAIIAN S B767 LONG-HAUL FLEET THREE OF THE ORIGINAL 2001 AIRCRAFT WERE PURCHASED BY HAWAIIAN. THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR EACH OF THE THREE AIRCRAFT WAS 50 250 000 THE FAIR VALUE AS OF PURCHASE DATE AS NEGOTIATED BY THE PARTIES. THE FAVORABLE AIRCRAFT LEASE INTANGIBLE ASSET RECORDED UPON HAWAIIAN S EMERGENCE FROM BANKRUPTCY ON JUNE 2 2005 HAD AN UNAMORTIZED DEBIT BALANCE OF 2.8 MILLION AS OF THE PURCHASE DATE. THIS BALANCE WAS WRITTEN OFF TO NON-OPERATING EXPENSE AS OF THE PURCHASE DATE AS THE LEASE ARRANGEMENT AND/OR TERMS GENERATING THE ORIGINAL FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS (THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES) ON JUNE 2 2005 WAS ELIMINATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE COMPANY BELIEVED THE WRITE-OFF OF THE NET INTANGIBLE BALANCE WAS REQUIRED AND APPROPRIATE UNDER THE STANDARDS AS NO EXISTING GUIDANCE COULD BE IDENTIFIED TO JUSTIFY THE CAPITALIZATION OF THE 2.8 MILLION INTANGIBLE ASSET AS PART OF THE AIRCRAFT ACQUISITION. THE COMPANY BELIEVED THE CLASSIFICATION AS A NON-OPERATING EXPENSE WAS REASONABLE DUE TO THE FOLLOWING: 1. THE SUBJECT AIRCRAFT NEVER LEFT THE OPERATIONS OF HAWAIIAN AND THE 2.8 MILLION CHARGE WAS UNRELATED TO THE OPERATION OF THE AIRCRAFT (E.G. THE FAVORABLE LEASE INTANGIBLE WAS RELATED TO RENTALS THAT NEVER WERE INCURRED). 2. THE AIRCRAFT PURCHASE WAS AT FAIR VALUE AND AS A RESULT THE FUTURE PERIODS WILL BE PROPERLY IMPACTED BY THE FAIR VALUE COST OF THE AIRCRAFT. INCLUDING THE REMAINING UNFAVORABLE LEASE COST IN OPERATIONS WOULD HAVE INAPPROPRIATELY RESULTED IN OPERATIONS BEING FURTHER IMPACTED BY MORE THAN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AIRCRAFT. FURTHER WE NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH SFAS NO. 144 ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS IS CLEAR ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES NO SPECIFIC GUIDANCE IS PROVIDED IN SFAS NO. 142 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH RESPECT TO CLASSIFICATION OF RELATED CHARGES FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS. BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC GUIDANCE THE CHARGES BEING UNRELATED TO ONGOING OPERATIONS AND THE FACT THAT OUR DISCLOSURE WAS CLEAR AS TO THE NATURE OF THE ITEM WE BELIEVE THE CLASSIFICATION AS A NON-OPERATION CHARGE WAS NOT UNREASONABLE. ______________________________________________________________________ NOTE 10.
