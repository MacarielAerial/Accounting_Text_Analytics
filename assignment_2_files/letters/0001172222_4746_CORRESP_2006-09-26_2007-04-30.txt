WE NOTE YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT 2. YOUR RESPONSE INDICATES THAT THE REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE SALE OF MILEAGE CREDITS IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE HISTORICAL USAGE PERIOD. PLEASE FURTHER CLARIFY YOUR DEFINITION OF THE USAGE PERIOD AS IT APPEARS AS THOUGH THE STUDY CONDUCTED TO OBTAIN THE AVERAGE IS BASED ON THE EARNING OF FREQUENT FLYER MILES THROUGH FLIGHTS RATHER THAN THOSE MILES THAT ARE PURCHASED. DEFINE FURTHER IF THE USAGE PERIOD RANGES FROM THE POINT OF SALE UNTIL EXPIRATION OF THE MILES OR ONLY UNTIL THE AVERAGE DATE SUCH CREDITS ARE TYPICALLY USED. INCLUDE IN YOUR RESPONSE THE GROSS AMOUNT OF SALES FROM THESE MILEAGE CREDITS (SEPARATE FROM THE REVENUE RECOGNIZED) IN EACH OF THE PAST THREE YEARS. WE MAY HAVE FURTHER COMMENTS AFTER REVIEWING YOUR RESPONSE. MILEAGE CREDITS EARNED BY FREQUENT FLYER MEMBERS EITHER THOUGH FLIGHTS OR THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN THIRD PARTY AFFINITY PROGRAMS ARE COMMINGLED AND ARE THEREFORE FUNGIBLE ONCE CREDITED TO A MEMBER S ACCOUNT. IN PERFORMING OUR STUDY WE ONLY INCLUDE MEMBER ACCOUNTS IN WHICH MILES HAVE BEEN EARNED THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN A THIRD PARTY AFFINITY PROGRAM. ALTHOUGH THESE ACCOUNTS FREQUENTLY INCLUDE MILEAGE CREDITS EARNED THROUGH FLIGHTS AS WELL WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS FACT HAS A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE DETERMINATION OF THE UTILIZATION PATTERN FOR THE MILEAGE CREDITS THAT ARE SOLD. THE HISTORICAL USAGE PERIOD IS DETERMINED ON A PERIODIC BASIS BY CALCULATING THE AVERAGE TIME BETWEEN WHEN A MILEAGE CREDIT IS EARNED AND WHEN THE MEMBER TAKES A FLIGHT RESULTING FROM THE REDEMPTION OF THE MILEAGE CREDIT. THE GROSS AMOUNT OF REVENUE DEFERRED BY HAWAIIAN UPON THE SALE OF MILEAGE CREDITS SALES WAS 37.2 MILLION 28.7 MILLION AND 20.8 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31 2005 2004 AND 2003 RESPECTIVELY. 2 ______________________________________________________________________ FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAWAIIAN HOLDINGS INC. NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES PAGE F-8 2. WE NOTE YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR PRIOR COMMENT NUMBER 6. IN REGARDS TO MAINTENANCE RESERVES IT APPEARS YOU BELIEVE THESE LEASE PAYMENTS SHOULD NOT BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SFAS 13 BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE THEY ARE EXECUTORY COSTS WHICH ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE DETERMINATION OF MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER SFAS 13. THE DETERMINATION OF MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS IN PARAGRAPH 5J OF SFAS 13 HOWEVER IS USED IN EVALUATING THE CRITERIA FOR CLASSIFYING LEASES AS OPERATING OR CAPITAL LEASES AND IN SPECIFIED DISCLOSURES IN LEASE FOOTNOTES. IT DOES NOT SERVE TO SCOPE OUR OTHER LEASE PAYMENTS SUCH AS EXECUTORY COSTS AND CONTINGENT RENTALS FROM THE RECOGNITION REQUIREMENTS OF SFAS 13. WE BELIEVE ALL NONREFUNDABLE PAYMENTS REQUIRED UNDER A LEASE AGREEMENT SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUCH UNDER SFAS 13 AND OTHER RELATED LEASE ACCOUNTING LITERATURE. PARAGRAPH 5N OF SFAS 13 (AS AMENDED BY SFAS 29) STATES THAT LEASE PAYMENTS THAT DEPEND ON A FACTOR DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE FUTURE USE OF LEASED PROPERTY SUCH AS HOURS OF USE ARE CONTINGENT RENTALS. NONREFUNDABLE MAINTENANCE RESERVES WHICH ARE OFTEN TERMED ADDITIONAL BASIC RENT OR SUPPLEMENTAL RENT IN LEASE AGREEMENTS VARY BASED ON USAGE OF THE AIRCRAFT. THEREFORE IT APPEARS THAT THEY ARE OR ARE SIMILAR TO CONTINGENT RENTALS. PARAGRAPH 15 OF SFAS 13 STATES THAT RENTALS ON OPERATING LEASES SHALL BE CHARGED TO EXPENSE OVER THE LEASE TERM AS IT BECOMES PAYABLE. THEREFORE WE BELIEVE YOU SHOULD CHARGE NONREFUNDABLE MAINTENANCE RESERVE PAYMENTS TO EXPENSE AS THEY BECOME PAYABLE. BASED ON YOUR RESPONSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADDITIONAL MAINTENANCE COSTS IF RESERVES ARE INADEQUATE. IN THIS REGARD YOU STATE THAT YOU BELIEVE YOU SHOULD DEFER COST RECOGNITION UNLESS ALL COST RISK IS TRANSFERRED TO A THIRD PARTY. IT APPEARS YOU ARE REFERRING TO THE NOTION OF ENSURING TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT ENTERED INTO PRIMARILY TO ACHIEVE A DESIRED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING RESULT. WE CANNOT CONCUR THAT THE CONSIDERATION OF RISK TRANSFER IS RELEVANT BECAUSE RESERVE PROVISIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED AT THE REQUEST OF THE LESSEE BUT RATHER ARE INITIATED AND REQUIRED BY THE LESSOR. IN THIS REGARD IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT YOU SOUGHT TO INCLUDE SUCH PROVISIONS TO ACHIEVE A DESIRED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING RESULT. PLEASE TELL US IF THIS IS NOT THE CASE. FINALLY IN YOUR PROPOSED CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY DISCLOSURE YOU STATE THAT YOU PLAN TO RECOGNIZE ANY EXCESS MAINTENANCE RESERVES RETAINED BY THE LESSOR AS ADDITIONAL RENTAL EXPENSE UPON TERMINATION OF THE LEASE. TO THE EXTENT SUCH EXCESS RESERVES WERE TO EXIST THIS ACCOUNTING MODEL WOULD RESULT IN RECOGNITION OF AN UNREALIZABLE ASSET DURING THE TERM OF YOUR LEASES. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS MODEL IS APPROPRIATE OR SUPPORTED BY GAAP. WE BELIEVE YOU SHOULD AMEND YOUR FORM 10-K AND RESTATE YOUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL NONREFUNDABLE MAINTENANCE RESERVE PAYMENTS AS EXPENSES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH HOURS OR CYCLES ARE FLOWN. THE COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGES THE STAFF S COMMENT. HOWEVER THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE OUR ACCOUNTING IS APPROPRIATE. AS DISCUSSED TELEPHONICALLY WITH THE STAFF ON SEPTEMBER 25 2006 WE WILL SEPARATELY PROVIDE AN ANALYSIS OF OUR ACCOUNTING FOR DISCUSSION WITH THE STAFF. 3 ______________________________________________________________________ NOTE 4.
